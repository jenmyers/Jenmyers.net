<p>This iteration of my personal website has existed in various versions since 2012. This version (<em>Baymax</em>) was launched in December of 2020. You can see the code of this and previous versions at <a href="https://github.com/jenmyers/jenmyers.net">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>I built this site with the static-site generator <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and I deploy it with <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.

<p>I use a modified set of icons originally from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/">Flaticon</a>.</p>

<p>Post images are an assortment of my own images, others in the public domain and some fairly used in the context of critical reviews. The default image found on multiple posts is of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Betty_Broadbent,_PIX_Magazine,_Sydney,_1938.jpg">Betty Broadbent</a>, a "tattooed lady" from the early part of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>I made everything else with HTML, CSS and large amounts of tea.</p>
