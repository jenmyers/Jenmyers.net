<img class="about-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jen.png" alt="Jen Myers, millionaire playgirl" />

<p>Iâ€™m a technologist and writer living in Chicago. I write <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/writing/">fiction and nonfiction</a>, send a weekly <a href="https://modernadventuress.com">newsletter</a>, produce a monthly <a href="https://quietlittlehorrors.com">podcast</a> and make short <a href="https://vimeo.com/antiheroine">videos</a>.</p>

<p>I have a background as a front-end web developer, tech educator and a diversity and inclusion advocate. In 2011, I founded the Columbus, Ohio chapter of <a href="http://girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a>, a nonprofit organization aimed at providing coding classes for women, and in 2013 I founded and taught <a href="http://codeandcupcakes.net">Code and Cupcakes Chicago</a>, a series of coding workshops for mothers and daughters. I have <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/speaking/">spoken</a> widely about web design and development, diversity/inclusion and tech education, and I sometimes <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/mentoring/">mentor</a> beginning tech speakers from underrepresented minorities.</p>
