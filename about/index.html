<p>Iâ€™m a technologist and writer living in Chicago. I write <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/writing/">fiction and nonfiction</a>, send a weekly <a href="https://modernadventuress.com">newsletter</a>, co-host a monthly <a href="https://quietlittlehorrors.com">podcast</a> and make short <a href="https://vimeo.com/antiheroine">videos</a>.</p>

<p>I have a background as a front-end web developer, tech educator and a diversity and inclusion advocate. In 2011, I founded the Columbus, Ohio chapter of <a href="http://girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a>, a nonprofit organization aimed at providing coding classes for women, and in 2013 I founded and taught <a href="http://codeandcupcakes.net">Code and Cupcakes Chicago</a>, a series of coding workshops for mothers and daughters that now offers open-sourced curriculum and workshop guides. I have spoken widely about web design and development, diversity/inclusion and tech education (reach out if you want to learn about my past talks or have a speaking opportunity).</p>
