<img class="about-image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jen-circle.png" />

<p>Iâ€™m a technologist and writer in Chicago. I write <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/writing/">fiction and nonfiction</a> mostly of the dark and/or horrific variety. I co-host a horror film podcast called <a href="https://quietlittlehorrors.com">Quiet Little Horrors</a>. While I currently have a career in technical writing and education, I'm also pursuing a degree in film studies.</p>

<!-- <p>I have a background as a front-end web developer, tech educator and a diversity and inclusion advocate. In 2011, I founded the Columbus, Ohio chapter of <a href="http://girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a>, a nonprofit organization aimed at providing coding classes for women, and in 2013 I founded and taught <a href="http://codeandcupcakes.net">Code and Cupcakes Chicago</a>, a series of coding workshops for mothers and daughters that now offers open-sourced curriculum and workshop guides. I have spoken widely about web design and development, diversity/inclusion and tech education (reach out if you want to learn about my past talks or have a speaking opportunity to offer).</p> -->

<h3>Website</h3>

<p>Jenmyers.net has been online since 2012. I released this particular version, <em>Bishop</em>, in February of 2023. You can see the code for this and previous versions at <a href="https://github.com/jenmyers/jenmyers.net">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I built this site with the static-site generator <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and I deploy it with <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.

<p>I made everything else with HTML, CSS and a bit of black magic.</p>
