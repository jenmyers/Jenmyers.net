<img class="about-img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jen.png" alt="Jen Myers, millionaire playgirl" />

<p>Iâ€™m a technologist and writer in Chicago. My fiction has been published in Coffin Bell, detritus and -insert another lit mag name here-. My film essays have been published in Bright Wall Dark Room.</p>

<p>Every week I send out email newsletter called <a href="https://modernadventuress.com">Modern Adventuress</a> and an original essay to paid subscribers every month.</p>

<p>I have a background as a front-end web developer, tech educator and a diversity and inclusion advocate. In 2011, I founded the Columbus, Ohio chapter of <a href="http://girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a>, a nonprofit organization aimed at providing coding classes for women, and in 2013 I founded and taught <a href="http://codeandcupcakes.net">Code and Cupcakes Chicago</a>, a series of coding workshops for mothers and daughters. I have <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/speaking/">spoken</a> widely about web design and development, diversity/inclusion and tech education, and I sometimes <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/mentoring/">mentor</a> beginning tech speakers from underrepresented minorities.</p>

<p>I keep a comprehensive yearly <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/log/">media log</a> if you're interested in the books, films, podcasts and performances I take in.</p>

<!-- <p>I also have a <a href="http://eepurl.com/dvnBrz">mailing list</a> where I send updates about what's going on with all my writing and projects at the end of each month. If you are looking for those details in a convenient format other than my weekly newsletter, it's just the thing for you.</p> -->
