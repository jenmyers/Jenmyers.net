<p>Iâ€™m a technologist and writer in Chicago. I write <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/writing/">fiction and nonfiction</a> of the dark variety. I co-host a psychological horror film podcast called <a href="https://quietlittlehorrors.com">Quiet Little Horrors</a>. While I have a career in technical education, I'm also currently pursuing a degree in Film and Television at DePaul University. I <em>also</em> singly parent a teenager, just for something else to do.</p>

<!-- <p>I have a background as a front-end web developer, tech educator and a diversity and inclusion advocate. In 2011, I founded the Columbus, Ohio chapter of <a href="http://girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a>, a nonprofit organization aimed at providing coding classes for women, and in 2013 I founded and taught <a href="http://codeandcupcakes.net">Code and Cupcakes Chicago</a>, a series of coding workshops for mothers and daughters that now offers open-sourced curriculum and workshop guides. I have spoken widely about web design and development, diversity/inclusion and tech education (reach out if you want to learn about my past talks or have a speaking opportunity to offer).</p> -->

<h3>Website</h3>

<p>Jenmyers.net has been online since 2012. I released this particular version, <em>Data</em>, in April of 2022. You can see the code for this and previous versions at <a href="https://github.com/jenmyers/jenmyers.net">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I built this site with the static-site generator <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and I deploy it with <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.

<p>I made everything else with HTML, CSS and a bit of black magic.</p>
