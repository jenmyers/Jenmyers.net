<p>I’m a technologist and writer in Chicago.</p>

<p>I've been making things on the web since 2000, and I have been involved in tech education and diversity/inclusion advocacy for several years—including as a chapter founder, teacher and leadership community manager of <a href="http://girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a>, and the founder of <a href="http://codeandcupcakes.net">Code and Cupcakes Chicago</a>. I have also spoken extensively about web development/design, diversity and education. I currently work as the director of open source curriculum at <a href="http://pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a>.</p>
