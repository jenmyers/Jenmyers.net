<p class="home">Hi, I'm <a class="about" href="about/">Jen</a>. I'm a web designer/developer, teacher and speaker. The most recent <strong>article</strong> I wrote is {% assign first_post = site.posts.first %} {% for post in site.posts limit: 1 %} <a class="writing" href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> {% endfor %}. I'm looking for my next <strong>speaking</strong> event, but my last talk was at <a class="speaking" href="http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-PHP-Meet-up/events/143745382/">Refactor Chicago</a>. The <strong>project</strong> I'm currently working on is the <a class="projects" href="http://highvisibilityproject.org/">High Visibility Project</a></p>
