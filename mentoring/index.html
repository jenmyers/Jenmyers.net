<p><em>Note: I am currently no longer offering mentoring sessions. If I return to them in the future, I will be announcing them in my newsletter.</em></p>

<p>Since 2013, I've been offering virtual mentoring sessions for beginning tech speakers, specifically for those from minorities underrepresented in tech. I try to offer two thirty-minute sessions every week and you can book sessions from this page. I also announce new sessions in my <a href="http://tinyletter.com/jenmyers">weekly newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more speaking resources.</p>
