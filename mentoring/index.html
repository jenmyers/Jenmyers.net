<p>Since 2013, I've been offering virtual mentoring sessions for beginning tech speakers, specifically for those from minorities underrepresented in tech. I try to offer two thirty-minute sessions every week and you can book sessions from this page. I also announce new sessions in my <a href="http://tinyletter.com/jenmyers">weekly newsletter</a>.</p>

<a href="https://calendly.com/jen-myers/speaker-mentoring/" class="button-hairline">Book a session</a>

<p>Stay tuned for more speaking resources.</p>

<p>Need some encouragement? Read some <a href="success.html">success stories from other speakers</a>.</p>
