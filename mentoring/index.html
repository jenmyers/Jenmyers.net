title: Mentoring

---

<p>Since 2013, I've been offering virtual mentoring sessions for beginning tech speakers, specifically for those from minorities underrepresented in tech. I typically offer at least two thirty-minute sessions every month and you can book sessions from this page. If you don't see any upcoming availabilities, sit tight. I only schedule a couple of weeks ahead of time so I don't overload my schedule. I announce new sessions reguarly in my <a href="http://tinyletter.com/jenmyers">weekly newsletter</a>.</p>
