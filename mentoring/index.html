title: Mentoring

---

<p>Since 2013, I've been offering virtual mentoring sessions for beginning tech speakers, specifically for those from minorities underrepresented in tech (specifically, people of color, women and those who identify as LGBTQA). I typically offer two thirty-minute sessions every week and you can book sessions from this page. If you don't see any upcoming availabilities, sit tight. I only schedule a week or two ahead of time so I don't overload my schedule. I also announce new sessions reguarly in my <a href="http://tinyletter.com/jenmyers">weekly newsletter</a>.</p>
