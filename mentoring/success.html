  <p>"I was completely intimidated by conference speaking, like there was this impassable gulf between me and the charismatic & confident experts on stage. And how are you supposed to apply? You decided you might want to start speaking, but what does that even look like?</p>

  <p>"It turns out, I mostly needed a gentle kick in the behind to just get started already, and scheduling that first meeting with Jen was magical for that. Jen took the time to answer *all* my questions, and gave great feedback on my proposal ideas. After a dry run of my first talk, she met with me *again* to help work through sections that had turned out to be really awkward.</p>

  <p>"I'd been scouring blogs for speaking tips, but there is something unparalleled about having someone look you in your own personal face and say that they're excited for you and that you'll be just fine at this scary new thing.</p>

  <p>"And now speaking has turned out to be one of the most rewarding things I do. I can't thank Jen enough for her encouragement & help; she's a super fantastic resource for speakers, both seasoned and new ;)"</p>

  <p>I signed up for a session with Jen on a whim, and I'm really happy I did. When I first started speaking, I was very unsure of myself. Being able to pick her brain and learn from her experiences was invaluable to me. I left the experience feeling much better about speaking, and I'm much more confident now. I can honestly say that my talk with Jen helped changed the course of my career. I can't thank her enough.</p>
