- Recently I’ve been learning about the [“Gutenberg Parenthesis”](https://commforum.mit.edu/the-gutenberg-parenthesis-oral-tradition-and-digital-technologies-29e1a4fde271) theory, of possible interest to others interested in digital folklore and/or theories of communication.
- Mason Currey is writing about creative block for the month of #blocktober, starting with writer George Gissing and the notion that [“power doesn’t answer to the will.”](https://masoncurrey.substack.com/p/power-doesnt-answer-to-the-will) He concludes: “sometimes what we experience as a “block” is … actually just what the creative process feels like.”

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I heartily recommended Isabel Cañas’s first novel, [_The Hacienda_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/eacf7074-799d-470d-a38c-6e2ff2d60fa7), not too long ago and now I’m recommending her second: [_Vampires of El Norte_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f641734f-73ba-4ffc-8229-1f632bf1ce6b). Mexican-set historical horror that’s consistently great.
- Since ’tis the season, I made my way through Lucy A. Synder’s story collection [_Halloween Season_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/887eaf9c-fc3b-492e-89d2-048e51250d21). Good for an October romp.
- I’m not sure if I need to tell the people who read stuff I write to watch [_The Fall of the House of Usher_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-fall-of-the-house-of-usher-2023/), but, for what it’s worth, I liked it quite a bit.
- I also liked [_Trick ’r Treat_](https://letterboxd.com/film/trick-r-treat/), which is several years old but I hadn’t seen it before. Another good October romp.
- If, like me, you collect vicarious morbid obsessions with people who do weird things, you might already know about extreme haunted houses and, in particular, McKamey Manor—and if, like me, you’ve long been convinced that dude should not be doing anything he’s doing, the new documentary on Hulu, [_Monster Inside: America’s Most Extreme Haunted House_](https://letterboxd.com/jenmyers/film/monster-inside-americas-most-extreme-haunted-house/), is here for you.
- And if you want more recommendations, Guillermo del Toro is also here for you.
