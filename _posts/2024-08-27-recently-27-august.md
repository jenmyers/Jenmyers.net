### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I read the novel [_Bunny Lake Is Missing_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/417009e4-df56-4e7a-8918-dd0e342faacc) by Evelyn Piper and enjoyed it greatly. I had seen the film adaptation a couple of years ago, but fortunately some of the nuances of it had blurred enough for me to take the novel on with a more or less fresh perspectiveâ€”although this book is forceful enough that it might have been able to stake out its clarity all on its own. Highly recommended, along with the film.
- I watched two new films that I might not be 100% on but were both original enough in one or more aspects that I appreciated them and think they're worth mentioning: 1) [_Cuckoo_](https://letterboxd.com/film/cuckoo-2024/) and [_Strange Darling_](https://letterboxd.com/film/strange-darling/). Both ride through on the strength of their performances, and both of the lead female performances are fierce and stunning.
- I caught up with last year's [_Lovely, Dark, and Deep_](https://letterboxd.com/film/lovely-dark-and-deep/), written and directed by Teresa Sutherland, and a great little gem of a psychological, cosmic horror with another strong lead performance.
- I saw [_Streets of Fire_](https://letterboxd.com/film/streets-of-fire/) on 70mm for the first time. I am changed, completed, fulfilled.
