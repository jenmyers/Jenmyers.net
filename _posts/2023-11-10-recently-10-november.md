### Links

- The world solved acid rain. [We can also solve climate change.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-world-solved-acid-rain-we-can-also-solve-climate-change/)
- [Why so many men worship assholes.](https://www.fatherly.com/life/why-do-so-many-men-worship-assholes)
- “We tend to dislike (and believe reprehensible) what we’re not regularly exposed to. And that often happens to be the language of vulnerable communities, such as black and brown people, teenagers and women.” This review of the book [_Like, Literally, Dude_ by linguist Valerie Fridland](https://literaryreview.co.uk/the-kings-english-forgeddabouddit) is excellent.
- [Why it’s important to remember Native creatures are not cryptids.](https://atribecalledgeek.com/native-creatures-are-not-cryptids/)
- If there is anything true about me, it's that I am always here for weird old automata.

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- Currently reading [_A Haunting on the Hill_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/25391d48-43a3-4c80-816f-5d29b22e29b7), Elizabeth Hand's authorized follow-up to Shirley Jackson's _The Haunting of Hill House_, and so far, I'm a bit mixed. Further updates as events warrant.
- I recently decided to go deep on Mary Shelley reading and I bought a big stack of books for the purpose. I started with [_The Monsters: Mary Shelley and the Curse of Frankenstein_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ce10da26-7c56-4164-8909-4c596c42bc8e) by Dorothy Hoobler and Thomas Hoobler, and I found it excellent. Recommended for those who want a good overview of Mary's life and her creation.
- [_Killers of the Flower Moon_](https://letterboxd.com/film/killers-of-the-flower-moon/) is a precise and brilliant mirror held up to long overlooked evil.  
- I haven't bothered to watch any of the recent Poirot adaptations because none of them caught my interest, but I heard better buzz about [_A Haunting in Venice_](https://letterboxd.com/film/a-haunting-in-venice/) and, lo and behold, I enjoyed it quite a bit.
- The [_Ghost Story_](https://wondery.com/shows/ghost-story/) podcast has it all: childhood ghost stories, vintage true crime, investigators, psychics, Hugh Dancy. It's a wild journey.
- Late autumn is the height of Nick Cave season.
