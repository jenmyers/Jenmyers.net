### Links

- “But billionaires are a menace to the rest of us: their sheer political size warps our public life. Disproportionately older, white and male, they function as unelected powers, a sort of freelance global aristocracy who are too often trying to reign over the rest of us.” [Rebecca Solnit.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/20/billionaires-great-carbon-divide-planet-climate-crisis)
- “‘New York is a place for the dreamers and we all come from somewhere. To leave, and leave your families behind, one would hope that you'd find love and meet people, have a family and maybe not end up alone in a hotel room somewhere.’” The story of [Hisako Hasegawa](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/15/1213003434/she-lived-in-a-new-york-hotel-for-more-than-40-years-but-her-life-was-a-mystery), who lived in room 208 of New York’s Belvedere Hotel for more than forty years without anyone ever really knowing her.
- Celebrating one of my favorite book series, which I still reread every year, even in my forties: 100 years of [_Emily of New Moon_](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/books/review/emily-of-new-moon-lucy-maud-montgomery.html).

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- [_Bloom_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3611fe7b-0830-43b4-b5b0-11b6852900b9), by Delilah S. Dawson, is wicked delight.
- Craig DiLouie's [_Episode Thirteen_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/afb3a965-f9a0-4096-a30e-b923c5598242), is a compelling "found footage" novel that takes advantage of its medium to go farther than film would be able to.
- If you follow the drama of the most infamous extreme haunted house, you might enjoy [_The Last Haunt_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/e753c994-41d7-48f2-a695-93752a50cde5), by Max Booth III, which adds a satisfying supernatural layer to it all.
- I am disappointed to report that I do _not_ recommend Elizabeth Hand’s [_A Haunting on the Hill_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/25391d48-43a3-4c80-816f-5d29b22e29b7). As a standalone book, it’s fine; as a Shirley Jackson follow-up, it falls short and, ultimately, its existence perplexes me.
- As an established Christian Petzold stan, I was happy that [_Afire_](https://letterboxd.com/film/afire/) hit the Criterion Channel this past week. It's much quieter than many of his other films, but who can resist Paula Beer.
- I finally caught up with [_Passages_](https://letterboxd.com/film/passages-2023/) and what delicious performances it has.
- There is a restoration of 1970 serial killer oddity [_The Strangler_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-strangler-1970/) going around and I found it entrancing and fascinating.
- My beloved television program _Wellington Paranormal_ is back with a podcast.
