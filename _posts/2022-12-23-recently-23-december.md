I'm in the mad rush to read all the books and see all the movies from this year that I haven't yet. Of course, I won't, but it's a fun game to play.

- “When I defend my right to look out the window, I am defending my right to witness so much: front stoops, dog walkers, graffiti, rain puddles, industrial corridors, hand-painted grocery signs, school kids all in a line. The river! The lake! Bikers and joggers and drivers obliviously picking their noses! Your brain must cast a wide net to catch it all. You experience a different city when you ride public transit through it.” [Staring out the windows on the city bus.](https://chicagoreader.com/city-life/comics-feature-city-life/inkling/let-us-stare-out-the-windows/)

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- The only thing I bought on Black Friday was a complete ebook set of all of the Paperbacks from Hell, lost horror classics from the 70-80s. I started working my way through them with Elizabeth Engstrom's [_Black Ambrosia_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/39b5b468-fd07-41f2-adfb-7a64be93ac13), which deserves all the praise I'd heard. I'm a big fan of stories about evil teenage girls and this one centers on one who manifests vampirism as a response to the world's threats. It's ripe for a wider rediscovery.

- If the words "gothic horror set in historical Mexico" work for you, get you to [_The Hacienda_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/834fe2f8-aa81-479c-ac35-f258c2fccb69) by Isabel Cañas. I loved it.

- So Chloe Okuno's [_Watcher_](https://letterboxd.com/film/watcher/) is great.

- [_Deadstream_](https://letterboxd.com/film/deadstream/) is a fun new entry of found footage horror and is worth a watch.

- [_Speak No Evil_](https://letterboxd.com/film/speak-no-evil-2022/) is not fun. I was incredibly stressed out for almost the entire runtime, but its horrific spectacle is hard to turn away from.

- I thought the first season of _Avenue 5_ maybe didn't quite come together, but it's so full of great performers and characters I that took a swing through the second season, which definitely comes together and is very funny and everyone should be watching it.

- I'm always on the lookout for a new scammer podcast to listen to and [_Sympathy Pains_](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sympathy-pains/id1617326066) fits the bill admirably.

- RIP Angelo Badalamenti.
