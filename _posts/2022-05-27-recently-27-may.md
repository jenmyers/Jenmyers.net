- “Reading these words, I consider how language and literature have illuminated my life, both supplementing and complementing my spiritual practice. And how the lark and the light could represent divine mystery, and how my bearing witness to the sliver of humanity lit up by literature helps me understand that mystery a little bit more.” [Prayer Consists of Attention: On Reading as a Spiritual Practice](https://themillions.com/2022/05/prayer-consists-of-attention-on-reading-as-a-spiritual-practice.html) (If this resonates with you, pair with Julia Cameron’s [_Seeking Wisdom: A Spiritual Path to Creative Connection_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f5838106-509a-4070-8d0e-190ce0e4fb61).)

- "Solitude can protect the seeds of creativity, and loneliness contains a priceless gift, if we can tolerate the initial discomfort, and avoid the seduction of despair." Roseanne Cash.

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- [_When Things Get Dark_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9e92e7dc-b30a-4475-a618-54e8e8561ab6), a collection of short stories inspired by Shirley Jackson and edited by Ellen Datlow, is really fantastic.
- I recently read the new gothic ghost story classic [_The Woman in Black_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/dc423601-1f00-4fa6-bccd-2ad9c0716f8c), by Susan Hill, for the first time and I should have read it far sooner.
- The underrated 1984 thriller/horror film [_The Hitcher_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-hitcher/) is now on HBO Max and worth catching.
- If you want your 90s alternative music fix, [this playlist will do this trick](https://twitter.com/perpetua/status/1528755421820997633).
