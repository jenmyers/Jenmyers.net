For context, I gave up any sort of pretension at objective "best of" lists long ago. I read, watch, and listen to what I can manage and like what I like. There are always things I miss or catch up on later. But here are things that I thought didn't suck in 2022.

- Films from 2022 I liked: [_Decision to Leave_](https://letterboxd.com/film/decision-to-leave/), [_TÁR_](https://letterboxd.com/film/tar-2022/), [_The Banshees of Inisherin_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-banshees-of-inisherin/), [_Glass Onion_](https://letterboxd.com/film/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery/), [_The Northman_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-northman/), [_Turning Red_](https://letterboxd.com/film/turning-red/), [_Emily the Criminal_](https://letterboxd.com/film/emily-the-criminal/). I liked a lot more horror films, but they get their own list (coming soon).

- Not from 2022, but I got the opportunity to see the rereleased [_Out of the Blue_](https://letterboxd.com/film/out-of-the-blue/), which was phenomenal.

- Television shows (either limited series or shows with seasons from 2022) that I liked: _The Bear_, _The White Lotus_, _House of the Dragon_, _Yellowjackets_, _Made for Love_, _Severance_, _Guillermo Del Toro’s Cabinet Of Curiosities_, _Barry_, _Our Flag Means Death_, _What We Do in the Shadows_, _Los Espookys_, _The Dropout_, _1899_, _Light & Magic_.

- My reading is always lagging a bit behind the newest releases, but books I read in 2022 (either from 2021 or 2022) and enjoyed: [_The Book of the Most Precious Substance_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/b916f060-2580-4bef-a70e-27dffb5c3a44) by Sara Gran; [_The Hacienda_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/834fe2f8-aa81-479c-ac35-f258c2fccb69) by Isabel Cañas; [_Just Like Home_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/e8b7bb26-c5b3-485d-9db8-09b806cbbde2) by Sarah Gailey; [_Queen of Teeth_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/53c19468-ee1d-48a3-a20f-7092f2f857da) by Hailey Piper; [_Men, Women, and Chainsaws_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/eff9c785-c1d9-4f35-a52f-9ec4f21adf37) by Stephen Graham Jones; [_The Death of Jane Lawrence_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/5386dd38-2fa7-44ac-a19f-1279823c73ff) by Caitlin Starling; [_Things Have Gotten Worse Since We Last Spoke_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c7f0058f-a50f-44f1-b56c-06f897a8c53a) by Eric LaRocca; [_When Things Get Dark_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9e92e7dc-b30a-4475-a618-54e8e8561ab6) edited by Ellen Datlow; [_Meet Me by the Fountain: An Inside History of the Mall_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ba57e2b9-ac08-4ca6-a3eb-ec6f4d6368b5) by Alexandra Lange; [_Novelist as a Vocation_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9a406c48-019d-405a-8524-89f9f75d7d9d) by Haruki Murakami.

- In the classic book category, last year I finally read [_Rebecca_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/fb103bff-ea61-4eef-b8ed-16acaab487e4) by Daphne du Maurier (wonderful) as well as J. Sheridan Le Fanu's [_Carmilla_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/282ca7c1-e12e-40c9-8a11-3e2f00db0dfe).

- Podcasts with 2022 seasons: [_You Must Remember This: Erotic 80s_](https://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/episodes/2022/7/11/erotic-80s-archive), [_Rabbits_](https://www.rabbitspodcast.com/episodes), [_Ghost Church_](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ghost-church-by-jamie-loftus/id1619557591), [_Sympathy Pains_](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sympathy-pains/id1617326066). I also really got deep into horror storytelling podcasts like [_Creepy_](https://www.creepypod.com/) and [_No Sleep_](https://www.thenosleeppodcast.com/).

- One of my 2022's resolutions was to go to the opera, something I had never done before. I went twice to Lyric Opera of Chicago and saw _Tosca_ and _Don Carlos_.

- Another resolution was to take a long-distance trip by train, which I did, from Chicago to New Orleans and back. That was good.

- I took a class to learn how to use my DSLR camera and photography became my new hobby, by which I remembered that you can do things without feeling compelled to perfect them, but rather just because you enjoy them.
