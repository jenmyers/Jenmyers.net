### Links

- My most anticipated film list of every year: [John Waters’s favorite films of the year](https://www.vulture.com/article/john-waters-best-movies-of-2023.html).
- I have a lot of quibbles with some of the details of this piece, but its thesis of a [new romantic era fueled by technology backlash](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/28/new-romanticism-technology-backlash) is an intriguing one.
- “Literature only ever exists as this subtle and sinuous thread that connects various lives—writers to readers, writers to one another, the dead to the living, the living to the unborn—and causes them to course together.” On the false solitude of the writer’s life: [“Every Weirdo in the World is on my Wavelength.”](https://thepointmag.com/literature/every-weirdo-in-the-world-is-on-my-wavelength/)
- If you were a movie fan in the 90s, you might feel as strangely moved as I do discovering [one of the last Suncoast stores still in the wild](https://rolandopujol.substack.com/p/gushing-with-nostalgia-suncoast-motion).
- On the purpose of personal websites: perhaps they should express that [we are poems, not software](https://robinrendle.com/notes/i-am-a-poem-i-am-not-software/).

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- [_White Horse_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f8ce9da8-3fef-4305-a892-ae89bac0f246) by Erika Wurth is a slightly wandering but deeply felt journey of an urban Indigenous woman to solve the tragedies of her family’s past with some knockout imagery and moments.
- I’m continuing to read everything I can about Mary Shelley and her mother Mary Wollstonecraft, so of course I checked off [_Romantic Outlaws: The Extraordinary Lives of Mary Wollstonecraft and Her Daughter Mary Shelley_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ff40e468-bb09-4c78-a0d2-2fb45c4e9545) by Charlotte Gordon, which illuminated both women well plus the many ways in which their lives mirrored each others.
- [_The Crime Is Mine_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-crime-is-mine/) is an utterly delightful French comedy about my favorite subject matter: women doing crimes and succeeding greatly.
- I’m currently compiling my 2023 list of things I liked as well as my separate favorite 2023 horror films list, so stay tuned for that if that is something you might possibly be into.
- TCM Remembers for 2023:
