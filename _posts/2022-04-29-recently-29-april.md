It's been several weeks since I did this sort of thing in my newsletter, so there's a lot to cover.

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- This one is going to end up one of my favorites of the year: [_We’re All Going to the World’s Fair_](https://letterboxd.com/film/were-all-going-to-the-worlds-fair/).
- I give a qualified recommendation of [_The Northman_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-northman/). I liked how uncompromisingly it took on mythic storytelling, but it didn't hook me as much as either _The Lighthouse_ or _The Witch_ did.
- [_Night's End_](https://letterboxd.com/film/nights-end/) is horror meets experimental film and it's incredibly well-crafted.
- I liked [_X_](https://letterboxd.com/film/x-2022/).
- I enjoyed the low-key horror satire [_I Blame Society_](https://letterboxd.com/film/i-blame-society/).
- I caught up with one of my favorite current detective novel series, the Roxane Weary books: [_Once You Go This Far_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7866a00f-b539-4bbe-919e-19c9d95cfdcf), by Kristen Lepionka.
- Rachel Yoder's [_Nightbitch_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/32437a9c-0cf3-4100-837b-9523ad1f3da5) is an exploration of motherhood, transformation and primal rage, and it's worth engaging with.
- I assume you're already watching [_Severance_](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/severance/). If not, you should probably do that.
- [_Archive 81_](https://www.netflix.com/title/80222802) didn't get a renewal, but if you like strange, creepy stories you should give the single season a spin. I like it better than its podcast origin.
- I assume you're also already watching [_Our Flag Means Death_](https://play.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GYf3LzwJV98JifQEAAAAO). If not, you should probably do that.
- [_Abbott Elementary_](https://abc.com/shows/abbott-elementary) is great.
- Because there are never enough documentary podcasts on cults, I recommend listening to [_Twin Flames_](https://wondery.com/shows/twin-flames/), a deep dive on a particularly insidious online organization.

Lately I've been hitting my gigantic, carefully curated 90s playlist hard. Nostalgia's a comfort in lieu of spring. So enjoy a tune.
