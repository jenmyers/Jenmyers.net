### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I filled in a gap in my reading of Stephen Graham Jones' work with his early novella, [_Mapping the Interior_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a7c14d76-5f27-4c0f-a6e3-a7d8391857c0), which is a stone cold stunner.
- Highly recommended for those who want a more nuanced take on the roles of women in David Lynch's work than has been historically put forth: [_The Women of David Lynch: A Collection of Essays_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/07f97111-06bf-4e84-8b74-3b99d4819d77).
- [_All About Evil_](https://letterboxd.com/film/all-about-evil/) is a campy, gory horror romp, and who doesn't want that.
- Rest easy, Julee Cruise
