### Reading/Watching/Listening

- A thoroughly original and psychologically brutal story: [_A Short Stay in Hell_ by Steven L. Peck](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/8dfa8c4a-8fb1-4288-94b7-ebdfc6f4d042).
- If you need me to tell you to watch the entirety of the Criterion Channel’s [Roger Corman + Edgar Allan Poe collection](https://www.criterionchannel.com/grindhouse-gothic-roger-corman-directs-edgar-allan-poe), consider yourself told.
- I’ve been reading Mason Currey’s collections of artists’ routines and working styles—[_Daily Rituals: How Artists Work_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/fcb8369a-64b9-42da-9381-c0a5334006e4) and [_Daily Rituals: Women at Work_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f8823ad8-1994-4cb9-825d-ca08adc48f51)—and I’m finding them very useful for training myself to prioritize my own work and to feel comfortable seeming like a total weirdo when that’s what works for me (and it usually is).
- This past week I saw Bruce Springsteen live for the first time. So that was pretty great.
