### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I mentioned this is in my last [newsletter](https://newsletter.jenmyers.net/a-list-of-things-for-january-2024/), but I read Twyla Tharp's [_The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/87d1fa33-0c95-4b68-b65a-08e7c9920b8d) and enjoyed it a lot. I've a ton of read a lot of creativity books over the past few years, on my quest to self-educate, and this is one of the best, full of practical yet straight-to-the-heart advice.
- One of my new passions is long-distance walking (I am finally old enough to admit I just really like to walk and I don't need to run around ever faster if I don't really want to) and I have been moving through a list of books on the topic of walking. [_Wanderers: A History of Women Walking_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/19495526-c825-4e5b-b1b8-ea716a54e175), by Kerri Andrews, seeks to correct the male-centric perspective in the history of walking memoirs. Her examples are exclusively white and mostly from the UK, but it's a generally positive jaunt through the stories of women trying hard to find some time and space for themselves.
- Currently reading: [_Lizzie Borden_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/924e18c7-01aa-48f4-8404-b5ee5f41a4d7) by Elizabeth Engstrom, which is amazing.
- [_Lisa Frankenstein_](https://letterboxd.com/film/lisa-frankenstein/) is as patchwork of a film as its inspiration, but those patches are made up of stuff I like, and these days I prefer weird and messy to neat and dull—so I'll call it a win.
- Another plus of _Lisa Frankenstein_ is that it's full of some of my all-time favorite songs—especially this one, which I'd like played at my funeral so you all can dance to it:
