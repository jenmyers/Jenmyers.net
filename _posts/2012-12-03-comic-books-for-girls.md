title: Comic Books for Girls
summary: A list of my favorite comic books I think all girls should read.

A couple of months ago, I posted [Books for Girls](books-for-girls.html), a list of my favorite books that I recommend to girls and the people who love them. It only made sense that I follow it up with a recommended list of my other favorite reading medium: comic books.

There is still a lingering cultural notion that girls don't read comic books. I have several memories of being a shy, awkward teenage girl in comic shops and wondering why everyone always did a double take when I walked in, until I guessed the fact I was always the only girl there might have something to do with it - although that realization hardly made me feel more comfortable. It was one of the reasons I started subscribing to my favorite titles through the mail. But that was in the mid-90s, small-town Midwest. Now, we have the community that is the internet, and no one is alone anymore. There is no way the stereotype can continue to survive with so many enthusiastic fans speaking up about what they love, and young people growing up in blissful ignorance of the old stigmas. I take my seven-year-old daughter to our local comic shop regularly (where everyone is open and friendly and there is almost always a woman behind the counter). My daughter and I have a joint pull list. For the past two years, she's gone to the Ohio Comic Con dressed in cosplay ([as Super Mario](http://instagram.com/p/QKoUyWvGs-/)). In the larger landscape, it's been pretty great that during 2012, there were two successful blockbuster movies based on comic books and [featuring two pretty badass female comic characters](http://-wondersmith.tumblr.com/post/28318419816/this-was-actually-suppose-to-be-some-badass). Girls definitely read comic books. And more are picking them up every day.

But, for a girl just starting out - where exactly does she start? I have a few suggestions.

The caveats: I cobbled together a comic habit as a teenager, abandoned it for many years, and just recently picked it back up in full in the past year. I hardly have a comprehensive breadth of knowledge about the best comics out there. I put this list together as a combination of personal current favorites and suggestions from others that are on my list to read and give to my daughter to read. Some of these are targeted to young girls, some to teens. I've marked them as such, but look into each selection to decide on its appropriateness for your individual girl.

###[Batgirl (New 52)](http://www.amazon.com/Batgirl-Vol-Darkest-Reflection-New/dp/1401234755)

First off, yes, I'm traditionally, deeply biased towards DC in general and the Batman universe in particular. I have a good justification for it - _Batman: The Animated Series_ is what first drew me into comics. I love Batgirl in all her incarnations. I chose to recommend the most recent, the "New 52" title penned by Gail Simone, for three reasons: 1) it's currently running and therefore very easy to get a hold of; 2) it features the most familiar Batgirl incarnation, Barbara Gordon, and is therefore a friendly introduction to newbies; and 3) Gail Simone is an enthusiastic, thoughtful, culturally-aware writer. I would absolutely recommend new readers dig back into Batgirl history and read about Cassandra Cain, Stephanie Brown and Oracle - but today's Batgirl is a smart, strong, sympathetic character and a great place to start with mainstream superheroine comics. Good for middle and high school girls.

###[Batwoman (Elegy)](http://www.amazon.com/Batwoman-Elegy-Greg-Rucka/dp/1401231462)

A lot has already been said about the significance of the modern Batwoman, one of the most prominent (if not the most) gay superheroes. The preface to this volume, written by Rachel Maddow, is a good example, and I'm not sure what else I can add. Kate Kane is a complex, interesting and passionate character and her stories have been consistently well-written. J. H. Williams III set a standard for distinctive, gorgeous artwork. Good for high school girls.

###[X-23](http://www.amazon.com/X-23-Vol-1-Killing-Dream/dp/0785147977)

I picked up this title late in its unfortunately short run. It was cancelled after only twenty issues, which was a shame because it was a great book and, at the time, it was the only Marvel title headlined by a female character. Now they have [Captain Marvel](http://marvel.com/comic_books/issue/42671/captain_marvel_2012_1), but I miss Laura's own spotlight. The teenaged clone of Wolverine, she is a former trained assassin learning how to overcome her programming. With the talented Majorie Liu's writing, _X-23_ was a refreshing, girl-focused coming-of-age saga. Later on, Phil Noto's wistful, lithe drawing style avoided the usual pitfalls of sexualized depiction of women in comics and was the perfect complement to Laura's story. I really wish this book was still going. But at least there are the collected volumes to enjoy. Laura is now in the _Avengers Academy_ book, another recommendation of mine. Good for middle and high school girls.

###[Spider-Girl (Legacy)](http://www.amazon.com/Spider-Girl-Vol-Legacy-Amazing-Spider-Man/dp/0785114416)

Spider-Man is my biggest comic blind spot. All the Marvel books I read growing up were X-Men and I also tend to gravitate towards books with central female characters. My daughter fixed on Spider-Man as one of her early favorite superheroes basically because he looked cool, not because she was reading the comics, so I never really bothered to correct my oversights. However - a friend recently sent this _Spider-Girl_ collection to me as a gift, and I found it excellent. It was a nice introduction to an universe I didn't know much about (which is pretty much what this article is here for). Good for grade school and above girls.

###[Princeless](http://www.actionlabcomics.com/shop/princeless-book-one-save-yourself/)

Pure fun, with a heroine of color who is witty and adventurous. And there is a dragon named Sparky. Really, I don't want to talk about this much, because it will delay you from reading it. _Fantastic_ for grade school girls, also good for older girls.

###[Robyn of Sherwood](http://indyplanet.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=7545)

A fairly straightforward adventure tale about Robin Hood's daughter. When I came across it online, I bookmarked it to buy for my daughter, who loved the Robin Hood play we saw this past summer. Before I bought it, though, we encountered the creator at a comic con, so I bought a copy directly from him; he was very sweet and signed my daughter's copy to her. Good for grade school and above girls. 

###[Rapunzel’s Revenge](http://www.amazon.com/Rapunzels-Revenge-Shannon-Hale/dp/159990070X/ref=ed_oe_h)

A Rapunzel-based tale set in a magical Wild West. I haven't read this one. It was suggested to me and it looks super cool. Good for older grade school and above girls.

###[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz](http://www.amazon.com/Wonderful-Wizard-Oz-Graphic-Novel/dp/0785145907)

Over the past couple of years, Marvel has been producing lovely, whimsical comic versions of all the original L. Frank Baum _Oz_ books. I adore them and so does my daughter. Good for grade school and above girls.

###[Girl Genius](http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=TO&Product_Code=GEN-BOOK1&Category_Code=GEN)

Long-running steampunk print-turned-web comic led by a strong, daring young woman. I haven't read this a lot, and I'm not really into steampunk, but it looks like fun. Good for grade school and above girls.

###[Zita the Spacegirl](http://www.amazon.com/Zita-Spacegirl-Ben-Hatke/dp/1596434465)

Another one I haven't read yet, but looks wonderful. Good for grade school and above girls.

###[Adventure Time: Marceline and the Scream Queens](http://www.midtowncomics.com/store/dp.asp?PRID=Adventure+Time+Marceline+_1205183)

This is the clearest example I've had so far of being an uncool parent. I don't watch _Adventure Time_. It's not negative judgment, it's simply that I don't have cable and haven't sought it out. My daughter, however, has got a hold of clips and loves it. She picked out this comic at the store and, from what I can tell, it's pretty great. Good for grade school and above girls.

###[The Plain Janes](http://www.amazon.com/Plain-Janes-Minx-Cecil-Castellucci/dp/1401211151)

I mentioned this briefly in my original [Books for Girls](books-for-girls.html) list - DC Comics experimented with an imprint called Minx, which produced graphic novels aimed at teenage girls. It was canceled after a ridiculously brief amount of time. But _The Plain Janes_ is worth going back and reading. It's full of young female misfits, coming-of-age high school drama and the power of rebellious art. Good for middle and high school girls.

___

Of course, as I said in my previous article, you don’t have to be a girl — in age or gender — to read and appreciate any of these. But if the barrier to picking up comic books ever seems unfairly thick for any girl you know, one of these might be able to change the balance.
