- "Grief is the expansion of the essential substance upon which we order our lives. It is an unfolding of our complete nature. This inevitable and natural condition of being is something that you will soon encounter, and ultimately, you will find that humour is the leavening component in this transformation."

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- A few years ago, I put Jenny Odell's book, [_How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/94ecd827-f0e4-4876-9db5-40c414e039cc) on my library hold list and then became too busy to pick it up and read it. With charming optimism, I always intended to try again at some point. Then, a couple of months ago, I found it at a library sale, laying face-up on a side table, seemingly waiting for me. I bought it and read it immediately, and it was exactly what I needed. Strongly recommended for anyone else sorting out their relationship to the online world as well as the offline one, especially in the wake of November.
- [_The Modern Myths: Adventures in the Machinery of the Popular Imagination_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/65ffba9d-8b34-4dca-a873-c5efa2450f33) by Philip Ball is a terrific look at modern myths, what makes a story truly mythic, and why myths thrive so well in the flexibility and excess of genre. Loved everything about this book.
- [_Gahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird_](https://letterboxd.com/film/gahan-wilson-born-dead-still-weird/) is a fairly pedestrian documentary, as documentaries go, but the subject, cartoonist and writer Gahan Wilson, is worth the watch. Streaming on the Criterion Channel.
- Some recent watches: [_Blackout_](https://letterboxd.com/film/blackout-2023/), a thoughtful refresh of the Wolf Man movie with an eye for toxic masculinity and the battles with one's inner demons; [_The Vourdalak_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-vourdalak/), a deliciously strange romp through vampire mythology; [_Woman of the Hour_](https://letterboxd.com/film/woman-of-the-hour/), a somewhat thin twist on true crime retellings that makes an honest effort; and [_Apartment 7A_](https://letterboxd.com/film/apartment-7a/), a prequel hampered by its heavy legacy but also making an honest effort to add more to the story.
- Finding some hope in the fact that sometimes we all come back around again.
