description:  Stuff that didn't suck last year.

For context, I gave up any sort of pretension at objective "best of" lists long ago. I read, watch, and listen to what I can manage and like what I like. There are always things I miss or catch up on later. But here are things that I thought didn't suck in 2023.

- Films from 2023 I liked: [_Fallen Leaves_](https://letterboxd.com/film/fallen-leaves-2023/), [_Priscilla_](https://letterboxd.com/film/priscilla/), [_Barbie_](https://letterboxd.com/film/barbie/), [_Anatomy of a Fall_](https://letterboxd.com/film/anatomy-of-a-fall/), [_May December_](https://letterboxd.com/film/may-december/), [_Passages_](https://letterboxd.com/film/passages-2023/), and [_Afire_](https://letterboxd.com/film/afire/). I liked to a slightly lesser extent: [_Master Gardener_](https://letterboxd.com/film/master-gardener/), [_Oppenheimer_](https://letterboxd.com/film/oppenheimer-2023/), [_Killers of the Flower Moon_](https://letterboxd.com/film/killers-of-the-flower-moon/), [_Lynch/Oz_](https://letterboxd.com/film/lynch-oz/), and [_The Boy and the Heron_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-boy-and-the-heron/). (I liked a lot of horror films as well, but I make them their own list, which will arrive on the website soon.)
- Favorite films not from 2023 that I saw for the first time this past year: [_Sorcerer_](https://letterboxd.com/film/sorcerer/), [_Simone Barbès or Virtue_](https://letterboxd.com/film/simone-barbes-or-virtue/), [_Long Day’s Journey Into Night_](https://letterboxd.com/film/long-days-journey-into-night-2018/), [_3 Women_](https://letterboxd.com/film/3-women/), [_Star 80_](https://letterboxd.com/film/star-80/), and [_Butterfly Kiss_](https://letterboxd.com/film/butterfly-kiss/). Two older films I saw in the theater worth mentioning: [_The Strangler_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-strangler-1970/) and the restoration of [_The Trial_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-trial/), which I hadn't seen since I was a teenager and thoroughly enjoyed.
- Television seasons and/or series I enjoyed: _Poker Face_, Season 1; _The Bear_, Season 2; _The Fall of the House of Usher_; _Perry Mason_, Season 2; _The Great_, Season 3; _Barry_, Season 4; _Succession_, Season 4; _Yellowjackets_, Season 2; _BEEF_; _Party Down_, Season 3; _Abbott Elementary_, Season 2; _What We Do in the Shadows_, Season 5; _The 12th Victim_.
- I'm never able to keep up with current year book releases (there are so many books to read you guys), but books I read that were 1) published in 2023 or late 2022 and read by me in 2023, and 2) very good: [_Beware the Woman_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/165fa14e-3960-41c3-9b99-920ad01f88ba), by Megan Abbott; [_Bloom_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3611fe7b-0830-43b4-b5b0-11b6852900b9), by Delilah S. Dawson; [_Don't Fear the Reaper_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0ac5aea3-c3b5-4869-8c75-0c0905205c08), by Stephen Graham Jones; [_Daphne_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c16815f9-69d0-49c1-a96f-464083430e65), by Josh Malerman; and [_Vampires of El Norte_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f641734f-73ba-4ffc-8229-1f632bf1ce6b), by Isabel Cañas. On the nonfiction front, I loved [_A Philosophy of Walking_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/31a7fedc-9d07-4b75-8b0a-87d04c632868) by Frédéric Gros. Books not from 2023 that I read for the first time: [_Perfume: The Story of a Murderer_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/b3a5475a-cfda-41ed-8d2c-788658f9483e), by Patrick Süskind; [_The Virgin Suicides_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/417922b8-8f74-4498-bc3a-60b1855d80b9), by Jeffrey Eugenides; and [_Picnic at Hanging Rock_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c6f945a0-3f11-4c99-8871-a49ef1e5edc6), by Joan Lindsay.
- Favorite podcasts from last year: [_You Must Remember This: Erotic 90s_](https://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/episodes/2023/erotic-90s-archive), obviously; [_Ghost Story_](https://wondery.com/shows/ghost-story/); [_American Hysteria_](https://www.chelseywebersmith.com/) in general but the [Jack Chick series](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/chick-tracts-pt-1/id1441348407?i=1000604925914) in particular; and [_Normal Gossip_](https://www.radiotopia.fm/podcasts/normal-gossip).
- I dug deeper into my newfound music, opera and related fine arts interests with performances of [_Carmen_](https://www.lyricopera.org/shows/upcoming/2022-23/carmen/) and [_The Flying Dutchman_](https://www.lyricopera.org/shows/upcoming/2023-24/the-flying-dutchman/), and a tremendous production of the [_Frankenstein_](https://joffrey.org/performances-and-tickets/23-24-season/frankenstein/) ballet that made me think art can do absolutely anything. I also attended the symphony for the first time, which was lovely.
- Towards the tail end of 2023, I started getting into computer games and the first one that I loved was [_Strange Horticulture_](https://www.strangehorticulture.com/). I'll have a lot more to report next year.
