### Links

- Joan Westenberg on [missing the old internet](https://medium.com/@joan_68303/i-miss-the-internet-c7e41544a8b9). I feel this deeply.

- I also feel this: ["I just want to go a concert."](https://defector.com/i-just-want-to-go-to-a-concert)

- Local historian Robert Loerzel is writing a fantastic series about the history of Chicago's Green Mill on his website and [the most recent chapter covers the intersecting history of Chicago silent film](https://www.robertloerzel.com/2023/07/05/where-charlie-chaplin-slept-and-other-essanay-episodes/). Highly recommended.

- [The “Insane Pirate” drifter and the double killing at the Fourplex.](https://www.narratively.com/p/the-insane-pirate-drifter-and-the)

- An investigation: [women who write while lying on their stomachs](https://merrillmarkoe.substack.com/p/women-who-write-while-lying-on-their).

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- When I get around to a book that has a something of a legendary status, the results are either ultimate disappointment or immediate awe. Now I'm reading Patrick Süskind's [_Perfume: The Story of a Murderer_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/b3a5475a-cfda-41ed-8d2c-788658f9483e) and it is very much the latter case.

- [_Film, the Living Record of Our Memory_](https://letterboxd.com/film/film-the-living-record-of-our-memory/) is a terrific documentary on film history, preservation, and archiving that touches on every culture and overlooked genre of film imaginable. Streaming on Hoopla.

- Also streaming on Hoopla is [_Code of the Freaks_](https://letterboxd.com/film/code-of-the-freaks/), a documentary with more of a video essay feel that takes a good look at the history of disability representation in film.

- Hey, I liked that [_Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny_](https://letterboxd.com/film/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny/) movie. For what it's worth.

- I also liked the third season of _The Great_. A little uneven but finished strong. I haven't heard word about a following season, but if that's all we get it will have wrapped up decently.

- New Lydia Loveless incoming.
