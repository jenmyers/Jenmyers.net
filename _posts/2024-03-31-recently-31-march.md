### Links

- "The future hinges on our ability to both reform the current system and create a new one that genuinely serves the best interests of humanity. To achieve this, we must break down data silos to encourage collaboration, create market conditions in which a diversity of options thrive to fuel creativity, and shift away from polarising content to an environment shaped by a diversity of voices and perspectives that nurture empathy and understanding."

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- A little late to the party, but Victor LaValle's [_Lone Women_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f264da3a-9961-43a1-b095-1166ec57f5a1) is straight-up fantastic.
- I got my pre-ordered copy of Hailey Piper's [_Cranberry Cove_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cd0e52f7-8f66-448e-9ced-303565cfe657), which I enjoyed very much. I'm a big fan of supernaturally horrific crime/noir fiction, I'd like to see more of it.
- Continuing my journey through books about walking, I read [_Wanderlust: A History of Walking_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/90d958bd-da10-49ba-b7bc-2c495f2e3da2) by Rebecca Solnit. This is a modern classic of the walking essay genre and for a good reason. History and commentary and idealism all at once.
- [_Love Lies Bleeding_](https://letterboxd.com/film/love-lies-bleeding-2024/) is awesome. I was a fan of the director's debut feature, [_Saint Maud_](https://letterboxd.com/film/saint-maud/), which has quite a different vibe; but _Love Lies Bleeding_ is an even stronger film.
- In my humble opinion, [_Late Night with the Devil_](https://letterboxd.com/film/late-night-with-the-devil/) rules.
- And, to wind down, I greatly enjoyed Wim Wenders's quiet, affirming character study, [_Perfect Days_](https://letterboxd.com/film/perfect-days-2023/).
- I have a ticket to see legendary metal band Girlschool when they're in my town soon, will my over-40 self actually make it there, let's see!
