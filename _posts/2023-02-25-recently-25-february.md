- “Then comes the reassembled self, the self you have to put back together. You no longer have to devote time to finding out what you are, you are just free to be whatever you want to be, unimpeded by the incessant needs of others. You somehow grow into the fullness of your humanity, form your own character, become a proper person — I don’t know, someone who has become a part of things, not someone separated from or at odds with the world.” [Nick Cave on growing older.](https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/02/07/nick-cave-growing-older/)

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I'm late to the party on Susanna Clarke's [_Piranesi_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/e1d6e158-da58-47de-ba83-8b8cfbc3d513), but what a beautiful book.

- [_Orphan: First Kill_](https://letterboxd.com/film/orphan-first-kill/) is a blast.

- I came across [_Last Girl Standing_](https://letterboxd.com/film/last-girl-standing/), a indie film from 2015, and while it's a bit wobbly, I liked its perspective and its commitment to its psychological premise. Worth checking out.
