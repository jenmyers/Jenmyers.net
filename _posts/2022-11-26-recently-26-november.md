It's getting cold out. Time to read more books and watch more movies.

- "So, I mean, I'm an optimist only because I've chosen that we don't know what's coming up. We just do not know, you know, so this gloomy sort of, you know, apocalyptic pornography in a way that's, you know, everybody's going, oh, this this is really going down. This this ship is sinking. This is it. Okay? It's bad. It's not looking good. But I have chosen to be optimistic for one reason. And that's not based on reality at all. It's based on you'll have a happier life if you're an optimist, period."

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- New nonfiction from Haruki Murakami: [_Novelist as a Vocation_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9a406c48-019d-405a-8524-89f9f75d7d9d). It's a gentle and accessible series of thoughts about being a writer and sometimes also writing.
- I read [_The Queen of Teeth_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/53c19468-ee1d-48a3-a20f-7092f2f857da) by Hailey Piper, a queer horror/sci-fi tale terrible in its beauty.
- In the Criterion Channel's current film noir collection, I took a chance on [_Caught_](https://letterboxd.com/film/caught/), a Max Oph√ºls film I knew nothing about, and was very pleasantly surprised. A finely crafted and reasonably progressive film.
- From Shudder's House of Psychotic Women collection, I watched [_The Demon_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-demon-1963/) (_Il Demonio_) and it was a sharp slice of lovely cinematography and acid commentary.
