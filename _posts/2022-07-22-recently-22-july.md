### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I finally watched [_The Swimmer_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-swimmer/), a 1968 film starring Burt Lancaster that is just as brilliant as I had heard it was. Recommended for languid existential summer angst.
- I read [_Dark Harvest_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/37e7e135-2649-44bd-854e-23f72bcf3afc) by Norman Partridge, which I had seen on several lists of necessary horror fiction, and turns out that was entirely correct. It's a knockout of a story and reminds me of Shirley Jackson, Ray Bradbury and Stephen Graham Jones all at once.
- Speaking of Stephen Graham Jones, who is prolific af, I discovered and read his novella, [_Men, Women and Chainsaws_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/eff9c785-c1d9-4f35-a52f-9ec4f21adf37) and I loved it.
- I previously recommended Caitlin Starling's _The Death of Jane Lawrence_ and now I recommend her novella [_Yellow Jessamine_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/6e623f3f-425b-41af-b0d3-7a8a0decae22), another twisted Gothic tale of plague, death and dark decisions.
- The podcast [_Los Feliz Murder Mansion_](https://thelosfelizmurdermansion.com/) is a deep dive into the modern legend of the same name and while it gets a little _too_ deep sometimes, I was surprised to learn that some of the most basic "facts" of this story are demonstrably the result of a singular, light-hearted hoax. It's an intriguing look at how urban legends grow and spread.
- [_Ghost Church_](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-ghost-church-by-jamie-lof-95721611/), a limited podcast series from Jamie Loftus, is a wry, thoughtful and heartfelt exploration of American spiritualism, in the strictest sense of the term.
