"Best of" lists are for squares. Real ones embrace the chaos of the "a bunch of stuff I happened to encounter last year that didn't totally suck." Here's my list for 2024.

- Films I liked that came out last year include: [_Love Lies Bleeding_](https://letterboxd.com/film/love-lies-bleeding-2024/), [_Perfect Days_](https://letterboxd.com/film/perfect-days-2023/), [_Anora_](https://letterboxd.com/film/anora/), [_The People's Joker_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-peoples-joker/), [_Furiosa_](https://letterboxd.com/film/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga/), [_Conclave_](https://letterboxd.com/film/conclave/), [_Last Summer_](https://letterboxd.com/film/last-summer-2023/) and [_Pictures of Ghosts_](https://letterboxd.com/film/pictures-of-ghosts/).

- I didn't watch a ton of new television shows, but I did think well of: _True Detective: Night Country_, _Ripley_, _Baby Reindeer_, season five of _Fargo_, and season three of _Girls5Eva_. I also rewatched two of my all-time favorite shows, _Twin Peaks_ and _Carnivàle_.
- Musically speaking, I spent most of the year digging deeper into classical music. I heard several symphony and opera performances. I particularly appreciated the experience of hearing Ravel's _Boléro_ and a suite from Tchaikovsky's _Swan Lake_ performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and _Rigoletto_ performed by the Lyric Opera of Chicago. I also deeply appreciated that I got to go to the Metropolitan Opera for the first time.
- And then, just to even things out, I went to the first metal show I've been to in, uh, twenty some years, and saw Opeth. So that was cool.
- In the coming year, I plan to read more books from the current year, watch more movies from past years, and go to way more concerts. Metal and otherwise.
