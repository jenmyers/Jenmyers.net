title: 25 More Things I Want To Tell My Daughter
summary: Another list.
category: articles

Last year, I wrote a list-poem of [things I wanted to tell my daughter](http://jenmyers.net/2013/09/11/things-ive-learned-in-life.html). As I noted then, I meant it not as much literally as I meant it a poetic reminder to myself of the lessons I've learned. Turns out, I'm always learning. So I made another list.

1. It is difficult is to create habits of having deep empathy with others while also making sure you don’t automatically put their needs before yours. Empathy is a tool to make more informed decisions, not a method with which to practice codependent self-gratification. I mention this first so that you can start thinking about it early.
2. Be selfish—but as a deliberate, mindful decision you make to take proper care of yourself, not a reflexive, thoughtless default.
3. Don’t worry so much. I know you do this. I know exactly where you learned the habit. I’m trying to set a better example.
4. There really is no need to worry. We’ve already been to hell and back and we’re still here. It’s amazing what people can survive, and even use to thrive. It’s okay if things go wrong or you make a mistake. Don’t be scared because something might go wrong. Just know you can handle it.
5. Don’t use your charm or personality to get away with behavior that is anything less than honest or honorable. This is harder to avoid than you might imagine.
6. If you get in the habit of using your personality to get away with or simply get things, you will end up always needing others’ approval to succeed. Except, somewhere deep inside, you will know you are fooling them and so you will not respect them. Then you’ll be in the trap of being dependent on the approval of people you'll grow to hate because you can’t be honest with them because you need them to feed the image you need to believe in yourself. I’ve seen people live and die this way. It looks successful on the surface but it’s miserable underneath. I would rather you be alone and considered unsuccessful than ever play this game.
7. You are already more than what others can give you.
8. I said this before, but do not be afraid of being alone. We breed in everyone an irrational fear of being alone, so I feel I have to contradict it at every opportunity. If you’re alone, you know you’re not compromising.
9. You may trust the wrong person at times. You may fall for someone’s empty charm. This isn’t your fault. You’ll pay a price for it, and chances are they will not, but it’s not your fault. This is an unjust truth that I haven’t yet learned to accept, but I can tell you it exists. If you figure out how to live with it, let me know.
10. Most, if not all, of the reality we take in every day is a construct. It does good to step away from it from time to time to remember that.
11. If you don’t like what others have constructed (and you shouldn’t), build something of your own.
12. Turn down your headphones. Please, just humor me.
13. When it comes to changing the world for the better, we’re playing a very, very long game. It wasn’t started by me and it won’t end with you. We take up the part that we can. The amount that you can do may grow and diminish in cycles. That’s okay. Do what you can.
14. I raised you to be a warrior (metaphorically speaking). But the choice of when, how, why and if to take up arms is always yours. I have no say in or judgment on that. Just know that you can fight if you want to or need to.
15. You have no idea how strong you are.
16. Insist that people know you and treat you as the individual you are, not what you seem to represent. Do not accept opportunities founded on this representation. Do not let a culture that doesn’t share your values determine your own value. (See again: #10.)
17. Well-intentioned people are sometimes not trustworthy. This is very hard to figure out. Have patience in gaining enough wisdom to separate intention from reliability.
18. When people start asking you if you have boyfriend, you have my permission to tell them to fuck off.
19. You don’t ever need my permission, or anyone else’s, to stand up for yourself.
20. Becoming a woman who can comfortably stand up for herself is a long, difficult process. The world is not in your favor on this one. Which is all the more reason to learn how to do it. (I’m still working on it myself.)
21. Keep yourself grounded.
22. Be ridiculously, enthusiastically proud of who you are.
23. You create things like I used to. You draw and write stories and they mean the world to you, and I will never tell you to let go of them just because the world won’t pay you for them. Never stop. We’ll find a way to make it work.
24. It’s never too late to start again.
25. In fact, it's necessary to start again. Every year, every day, every chance to start again: take it. Look back and ahead only as it's useful to you to create a new moment. You can start again every minute. You should start again every minute. All the lessons you've learned are only as good as you use them to make something new.

Happy new year. Go make something awesome.
