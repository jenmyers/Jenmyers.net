### Links

- [Good night to the incomparable Shelley Duvall.](https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/8533-fascinating-shelley-duvall)

- A handy guide to [Miyazaki's weird little guys](https://www.vulture.com/article/miyazaki-weird-little-guys.html).

- [What the internet looked like in 1994.](https://www.fastcompany.com/91140068/how-the-internet-went-mainstream-in-1994) I just want to go back.

- "I want, though, for us to have the time, the space, the mental bandwidth to welcome uncertainty, to crank up our curiosity and give the weird or confusing or just slightly unexpected books a chance. And I want it to be totally okay and acceptable and normal to say 'I don’t entirely understand what I just read, but I loved it.'"

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- Hey, so, movies. I watch 'em. In new release news, I saw [_MaXXXine_](https://letterboxd.com/film/maxxxine/), which I found somewhat disappointing. I saw [_Longlegs_](https://letterboxd.com/jenmyers/film/longlegs/1/), which, by virtue of coming from my boy Oz Perkins, I liked (more thoughts at the linked Letterboxd review). 

- As previously mentioned, I read the novel _Under the Skin_ a couple of months ago and that set up me for finally watching the [film adaptation of the same title](https://letterboxd.com/film/under-the-skin-2013/). Immediately after reading the novel, I couldn't figure out how the hell anyone had adapted it into a film; after watching the film, I understood they did with with deep atmosphere and oblique beauty. I am glad I read the book first, but the film is its own elegant beast.

- My current indie horror pick: [_Loop Track_](https://letterboxd.com/film/loop-track/) (now streaming on Shudder). Stay away from spoilers, because its chief delight is how carefully it sets the expectation for one sort of movie and then delivers something else entirely. _Wellington Paranormal_ fans (which should be all of you, because that show is amazing) will recognize the star/writer/director Thomas Sainsbury. Solid film and the reveal is one I legit didn't see coming.

- I read [_Several People Are Typing_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2beec0a3-d2a3-43e2-a7d3-b09ceba8c151) by Calvin Kasulke and enjoyed it quite a bit. Your mileage may vary based on your experience with and tolerance of Slack, since the whole story is told in Slack messages—but I've been working remotely for more than twelve years, so I'm well situated for an existential horror tale that takes place in a piece of software (although maybe who isn't these days).

- Just a note that in the sweaty, restless days of late summer, you can still make a run for it:
