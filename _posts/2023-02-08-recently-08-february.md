### Links

- “There is an emerging pattern of women giving some of the best performances of the year and being ignored because of the genre, one that has often been driven by women, creatively, performance-wise, and thematically.” [Why do the Oscars hate horror movies?](https://www.avclub.com/why-do-the-oscars-hate-horror-movies-1850001085)

- [Why physical media matters.](https://www.avclub.com/why-physical-media-matters-streaming-era-1850080850) This is nothing groundbreaking for my usual crowd, but still worth a mention.

- “Anything I can do to have fun, and be less overly focused on how this is going to help me commodify myself, seems like a good way to keep the party going.” [Charlie Jane Anders on the loathsome concept of careers.](https://buttondown.email/charliejane/archive/i-still-loathe-the-concept-of-careers/)

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- The epic documentary series about 80s horror movies is now back on Shudder with its last chapter: [_In Search of Darkness Part III_](https://letterboxd.com/film/in-search-of-darkness-part-iii/). Since it’s the last part, this one has the most obscure and interesting selections and I liked it best.

- So, [_Skinamarink_](https://letterboxd.com/film/skinamarink/). That happened. I liked this a lot, but it’s often hard to put words to highly experimental film. You just have to sink into it. If you take this one on, do it seriously. _Commit._

- On the Criterion Channel, there’s a small collection of Robert Siodmak-directed films noir and I watched the only one I hadn’t previously seen: [_The Suspect_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-suspect/). A relatively straightforward late Victorian period murder tale elevated by an achingly sensitive and sympathetic Charles Laughton performance.

- I’ve been reading too many grim books lately and I’m trying to shift out of that for a bit. But if you’re in the mood for a grim book, I can definitely recommend [_The Auctioneer_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/244454f8-819d-448b-a4d7-2e04ac33892d) by Joan Samson. It’s very good. It also might slightly crush your soul. Although it does end well! More or less.

- New podcast alert for fellow modern folklore and mythology enthusiasts: [_Digital Folklore_](https://digitalfolklore.fm/) has just begun but I’ve already learned some fascinating things and added a few books to my reading list.

- February is usually a rough time of year for me, dim and depressing. So I've been listening to a lot of Nick Cave lately.
