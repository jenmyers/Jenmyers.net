### Links

- [Good night to the great, endlessly compelling Donald Sutherland.](https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/8517-tributes-to-donald-sutherland)
- On [Springsteenâ€™s _Nebraska_ and the deindustrialized Midwest](https://www.midstory.org/watch-the-river-rush-on-springsteens-nebraska-and-the-deindustrialized-midwest/).
- [The waning days of the manual elevators](https://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/the-waning-days-of-the-manual-elevators/) in Chicago's Fine Arts Building. Note: I used to visit this building regularly and the manual elevators inspired my flash fiction piece, ["The Elevator Operator."](https://talesmoonlitpath.com/fiction-3/the-elevator-operator/)
- Of course I'm fascinated by the [people who won't let go of floppy discs](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240510-floppy-disks-why-some-people-are-still-in-love-with-this-obsolete-computer-storage-technology). And here I thought I was already on top of all the vintage technology I could possibly have.

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I thought I knew a decent amount about Vivian Maier, but turns out 1) I didn't, and 2) I knew even less about the truth of the people who "discovered" her work. Pamela Barros's [_Vivian Maier: A Photographer's Life and Afterlife_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/47fe7ef4-bfb0-441d-9581-2eebd99e808a) is even-handed but subtly illuminating about the way her reputation was somewhat plundered (in my new opinion) by men for their own profit. Really worth a read.
- I have been moving and unpacking and settling for a month now, so I haven't seen any new movies. I did, however, catch [_Seconds_](https://letterboxd.com/film/seconds/), which was striking and resonant.
- Is it too late to bring back _Avenue 5_? Because I really want to bring back _Avenue 5_. This is not related to anything but the fact I recently did another rewatch and I just really want to bring back _Avenue 5_.
