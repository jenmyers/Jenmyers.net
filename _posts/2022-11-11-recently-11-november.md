It is November now and I am currently eight books behind schedule to reach my yearly reading goal. I still believe in the dream.

Denying this fact only provides more fertile ground for fear to take root. Worse yet, denying it robs us of our agency to meet and overcome it."

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I read [_The Rust Maidens_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/393c6baa-86ee-4323-bc43-2ff419201479) by Gwendolyn Kiste, a quietly horrific magic realism tale of growing up and leaving, or not, the Rust Belt.
- Last spring in New Orleans, I browsed one of its many, many great bookshops and picked up [_The Writing Habit_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/72d4b157-2aa9-49e5-979b-d4e7537f90a3) by David Huddle. I was not familiar with this book or its author at all, but since solidifying my own writing habit has been my primary goal lately, I bought it. It sat patiently in one of my book stacks until it was time to read it, which is now. And it's exactly what I need to read right now. This one might not be on the usual lists of craft books for writers, but I recommend it for those looking for such.
- I saw a screening of Noah Segan's _Blood Relatives_, which I enjoyed a lot. [A bit more over at Letterboxd.](https://letterboxd.com/jenmyers/film/blood-relatives-2022/)
- I also enjoyed _Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities_ on Netflix. While ostensibly a series of roughly hour-long episodes, each one seems to have been given to an individual director with free rein, so they more accurately resemble small films. My entirely subjective, but also completely correct, ranking:

1. "The Murmuring"
2. "The Autopsy"
3. "The Outside"
4. "The Viewing"
5. "Graveyard Rats"
6. "Lot 36"
7. "Pickman's Model"
8. "Dreams in the Witch House"
