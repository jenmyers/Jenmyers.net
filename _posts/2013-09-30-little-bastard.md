No one understands James Dean. At first glance, there isn't much there to understand. He's an one-dimensional stereotype on faded film. A cardboard cutout in the kitchy mall souvenier store. He moved so swiftly from emerging artist to tragic myth that, over half a century since that slick little Porsche Spyder went left of center, all we know of him is a reflection of what we want from him.

When I was a teenager, I had a poster of James Dean on my wall. One of the Roy Schatt photos, of Dean walking down a 1954 street, cigarette in mouth, hands in pockets, brow slightly furrowed. His brow was always slightly furrowed in photos. As if he were perpetually puzzled by or frustrated at the world around him. I had other photos of him, too, pinned up carefully for regular view. Not for the reasons you would expect from a teenage girl, though. I didn't ever want to have James Dean. That's wasn't good enough. Instead, I wanted to be him.

His distant, romantic masculinity paradoxically lended itself well to gender role confusion. He liked fast cars, and reading poetry. He perfected the image of the tough loner, and sought out opportunities to reveal inner anguish. He was passionate about art. He liked pretty actresses. There are photos of him in ballet classes. There are stories about his bisexual experimentation. His most famous character blamed his father's lack of patriarchial strength for his own lack of stability, and yet expressed his disillusionment with such a range of emotion and sensitivity that no one could say for sure that he didn't have cause for what he felt after all.

My favorite stories about James Dean are the ones about when he first came to Hollywood. A farm kid from Indiana, trying to capture a truth beyond what humans perceived on a daily basis. He was voracious with literature, acting theory, life experience. He was full of curiosity and the conviction there was something out there to find. As we all are in youth.

He was twenty-four when he died, in a horrific car accident on a twisted road in California, on September 30, 1955. He had made only three movies, and only one of them had been released at the time. But myth was already out of his hands.

James Dean was a good actor, but I always believed he would have been a great director. He had a gift for perspective and perception. He understood the nuances of complex emotion. He was just crazy enough to make meaningful art. Maybe I also believe he deserves to be thought of as a director, as someone who has the agency to shape a story out of his own reality. Rather than the misunderstood hero, the flattened rebel cliche. The victim. The simplification we prefer to the truth.

Growing up is far more difficult than dying young.
