### Links

- Colin Dickey on [Betty Boop in Snow-White, Twin Peaks, and the erotic life of things](https://www.hilobrow.com/2023/06/15/in-the-mystery-cave-1/).

- _Texas Monthly_ is undefeated in powerful, empathetic crime story pieces and this one about [Stephenville and Susan Woods](https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/susan-woods-stephenville-murder-hidden-killer/) is yet another example.

- [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden.](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

- Kat Howard on retelling stories and the theory of [a continual retelling](https://epigraphtoepilogue.substack.com/p/a-continual-telling).

- "Art is entirely indifferent to our self-annihilating excuses, special case pleas and circumstantial grievances. We must cease to concern ourselves with our unique suffering – whether we are happy or sad, fortunate or unfortunate, good or bad – and give up our neurotic and debilitating journeys of self-discovery." [Nick Cave.](https://www.theredhandfiles.com/how-can-i-find-my-own-identity/)

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I shouldn't need to recommend the latest Megan Abbott novel, because you should have preordered and read it immediately already, but just in case: [_Beware the Woman_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/165fa14e-3960-41c3-9b99-920ad01f88ba) is terrific.

- [_Gentle Writing Advice: How to Be a Writer Without Destroying Yourself_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2b37fbf2-db19-4835-b8ab-777eaee22ee0) by Chuck Wendig is a wise and worthwhile volume.

- I never read the original _Mary Poppins_ stories, but many years ago I read P.L. Travers's collection of different versions of the Sleeping Beauty tale and I knew she had a strong interest in folklore and mythology. [_What the Bee Knows: Reflections on Myth, Symbol, and Story_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/37df0d46-47e2-4d47-8ed8-d18a221aab75) is a compendium of her essays and I loved it.

- There are few pieces of art as foundational to me as _The Wizard of Oz_ is and I also happen to enjoy the many works of Mr. David Lynch—therefore, I liked the documentary/longform video essay that is [_Lynch/Oz_](https://letterboxd.com/film/lynch-oz/). Although I wished it would have been more thoughtful about what storytelling traditions _Wizard_ itself called back to.

- This is one of those ones from the "I can't believe I'm only watching this now" files, Robert Altman's [_3 Women_](https://letterboxd.com/film/3-women/) is excellent.

- One of my least defensible positions is that I love PG-13 horror movies. I cannot tell you why. I just do. Especially when they manage to bring something interesting and/or real to the table, which I think [_The Boogeyman_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-boogeyman/) does. It's worth checking out.

- Happy summer. Here's Florence singing about murderous, drunken mermaids.
