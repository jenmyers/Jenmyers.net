### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I've been reading some horror classics from the 1970s lately. First recommendation: [_Burnt Offerings_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2640193e-89e0-4302-8962-d48d151fd488) by Robert Marasco. I like the film this is based on just fine, but the book is fantastic.
- I also read Ira Levin's [_The Stepford Wives_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/fca4a904-1aa3-4790-b6b9-395215c3f5cb), which is a swift and worthwhile read.
- Experimental horror filmmaker Jennifer Reeder's new film [_Perpetrator_](https://letterboxd.com/jenmyers/film/perpetrator/) is now streaming on Shudder. [I wrote a bit about it on Letterboxd.](https://letterboxd.com/jenmyers/film/perpetrator/) TL;DR: I'm a fan.
- [_The American Scream_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-american-scream-2012/) is a documentary about three families who create elaborate haunted house walkthroughs at their homes every Halloween and it is the perfect way for people who love Halloween to prep for the season (streaming on Peacock).
- My favorite metal band, [Baroness](https://yourbaroness.com/), has a new album out, so that's what's spinning now.
