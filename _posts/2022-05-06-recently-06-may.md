### Links

- "If you are today feeling for this first time like the government is demanding control over your gender and sexuality and bodily autonomy, you are, sadly, in numerous company. But that also means that there are countless people around you who already know that freedom, certainly now and maybe always, will not come solely from what the law can recognize."

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I finally saw [_Broadcast Signal Intrusion_](https://letterboxd.com/film/broadcast-signal-intrusion/), a slow-burn horror I heard a lot of buzz about last year, and I mostly think it was worth the wait. (On Shudder now, by the way.)
- Speaking of slow-burn horror, [_The Strings_](https://letterboxd.com/film/film:652888/) is about as slow-burn as they come. I'm on the edge of wondering if this was too oblique for its own good, but overall I was with it. (Also on Shudder now, by the way.)
- The third season of [_Barry_](https://www.hbo.com/barry) has started. I love this show.
- [_Made for Love_](https://play.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GYFE2Tg8P-76tMQEAAAAS) is apparently now in its second season, but I just discovered it—but I think this dark comedy tech satire flew under the radar and deserves more attention. Cristin Milioti and Ray Romano are great in it.
- I read Marisha Pessl's [_Night Film_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ab101261-3fb6-44e3-91a3-14ac4aec66e3), a thriller about a reclusive horror film director and the possible cult of black magic surrounding him. This seems destined to become a found-footage-style movie, but no one's got there yet.
- I'm reading [_The Trial of Lizzie Borden_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/d716616f-8fe1-4c2a-9295-cef07740606b),a detailed recounting of the infamous trial written by an actual lawyer, Cara Robertson, and it's terrific.
- I always feel it's unnecessary for me to recommend the _You Must Remember This_ podcast because it's so good and so well-established, but, for what it's worth, the current [Erotic 80s](https://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/episodes/porno-chic-and-the-brief-heyday-of-x-ratings-erotic-80s-part-1) season is shaping up to be one of my favorites.
- I'm newly, completely obsessed with Orville Peck.
