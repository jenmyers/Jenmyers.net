Way back in 2007, I created an account on a website called Twitter, because I basically created accounts on every website that popped into existence. Possessed of a name not overburdened with uniqueness, I accepted the fact that I would never be able to secure my real name as an username and instead grabbed unthinkingly for one I had used on another site previously simply because I liked the sound of it - [antiheroine](http://twitter.com/antiheroine).

Almost six years later, Twitter handles are synonymous with identity, and, especially as someone active in the tech community who speaks, travels and organizes, I have often been identified in person as "antiheroine." I've never minded this. I feel fortunate, honestly, that I managed find a way to redefine myself that suited my personality and philosophy perfectly, and to grow into it naturally.

But that raises the question of: what does "antiheroine" even mean? It's a valid question. So I'll tell you.

First of all, "heroine" is the female form of "hero." It does not refer to the drug. I have occasionally been complimented on Twitter for my anti-drug stance. Mind you, I'm not pro-heroin. But that's not really what I'm going for here.

Beyond that, the literary tradition of the [antihero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihero) is one I've always been drawn to. It has an even stronger tradition in cinema, especially beginning in the 1960s. I'm fascinated with the idea of what constitutes a hero and how that definition reflects whatever values a society has deemed most important at that time. Often, it turns out an antihero is nothing more than someone who doesn't fit the status quo and who sometimes represents true heroism where societal values are found lacking.

This becomes even more relevant when we go out of our way to specify the hero's gender. When thinking about the myriad expectations society places on women in order for them to be seen as good or successful, it becomes an act of heroism to challenge them. It wasn't that long ago that "good" women were ones who stayed quiet, subservient and in the places prescribed for them by in a society led by men. "Heroines" then were the women who followed all the rules of behavior and appearance dictated to them, regardless of their own opinions on the matter. Maybe that wasn't even all that long ago. Maybe, in many ways, it's still happening. In that kind of society, the antiheroine is not an aberrance. She is the only morally right response.

But it's not really about having to be morally right in the end. It's about the challenge, the process of examining and improving our heroes and our values to make sure they aren't stifling individuals and societal progress. Sometimes, that will lead us into deeply grey areas. Sometimes, our antiheroines will make mistakes and take wrong turns and do things that should not be emulated. That's okay. That's not what makes them worth paying attention to. What makes them important is what we learn from them and how we apply it to our own process of examining and improving ourselves.

I'm a never-married single mother with piercings, tattoos and dyed hair who has made a career in technology. I felt at various points in my life that I wasn't supposed to do any of that. And, granted, I didn't always intend on doing exactly that. (Although you might be surprised to learn the technology career was the most unexpected.) And, yet, I've done all of it and, at this point in my life, I feel it turned out all the way it should have, and that in the process of doing it, I've learned to express exactly who I am and exactly what I'm here to do.

Now I'm at a point where people claim my username is ironic. They're right. It is. Because heroism is not, and never has been, a fixed binary value system and we'll do a lot more heroic things if we keep that constantly in mind.
