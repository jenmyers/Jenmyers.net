description:  Stuff that didn't suck last year.
---

A few years ago I tossed out any attempts at "best of" lists at the end of the year in favor of highly subjective and thoroughly non-comprehensive lists of things I liked. Over the past two years, as the world turned up its difficulty level, my year-end lists evolved even more away from value judgments and more towards simple appreciations. And so I present, without further context, a bunch of stuff from the past year that I thought didn't suck.

- Films from 2021 I liked include: [_Pig_](https://letterboxd.com/film/pig-2021/), [_The Green Knight_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-green-knight/), [_Zola_](https://letterboxd.com/film/zola/), [_Shiva Baby_](https://letterboxd.com/film/shiva-baby-2020/), [_Drive My Car_](https://letterboxd.com/film/drive-my-car/), [_Licorice Pizza_](https://letterboxd.com/film/licorice-pizza/), [_Nightmare Alley_](https://letterboxd.com/film/nightmare-alley-2021/) and [_Undine_](https://letterboxd.com/film/undine-2020/).

- I watched a ton of older new-to-me films but the highest highlight was finally being able to see Andrzej Żuławski's [_Possession_](https://letterboxd.com/film/possession/).

- There were a lot of great new horror films, but [I made them their own list](https://jenmyers.net/notes/favorite-horror-films-of-2021.html).

- I watched so much television. Limited series I liked: _Midnight Mass_, _Brand New Cherry Flavor_ and _WandaVision_. Shows with 2021 seasons I liked: _Mythic Quest_, _Ted Lasso_, _What We Do in the Shadows_, _Wellington Paranormal_, _A.P. Bio_, _Girls5Eva_, _Hacks_, _Dickinson_, _The Great_, _Physical_, _The White Lotus_, _Loki_, _Kevin Can F*ck Himself_ and _Only Murders in the Building_.

- Books from 2021* I liked include: [_The Turnout_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55573785-the-turnout) by Megan Abbott, [_A Certain Hunger_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53180064-a-certain-hunger) by Chelsea G. Summers, [_Billy Summers_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56852407-billy-summers) by Stephen King, [_Dream Girl_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55425157-dream-girl) by Laura Lippman, [_My Heart Is a Chainsaw_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55711617-my-heart-is-a-chainsaw) by Stephen Graham Jones, [_The Final Girl Support Group_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55829194-the-final-girl-support-group), [_Experimental Film_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54883466-experimental-film) by Gemma Files, [_Killer, Come Back to Me: The Crime Stories of Ray Bradbury_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52979067-killer-come-back-to-me) by Ray Bradbury, [_First Person Singular: Stories_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54614599-first-person-singular) by Haruki Murakami and [_Tarot for Change: Using the Cards for Self-Care, Acceptance, and Growth_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57169050-tarot-for-change) by Jessica Dore. * _Some books here came out in late 2020 but I read them in 2021 so I threw them in._

- Two classics I finally read in 2021 and enjoyed greatly: _The Tenant of Wildfell Hall_ by Anne Brontë and _The Woman in White_ by Wilkie Collins.

- I listened to a lot of older podcasts this past year, but the new standouts were: [_The Left Right Game_](https://qcodemedia.com/theleftrightgame), [_You Must Remember This, Gossip Girls: Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper_](https://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/episodes/category/Gossip+Girls), [_The Opportunist: Sherri Shriner_](https://kastmedia.com/podcasts/the-opportunist/), [_Murder in Alliance_](https://www.murderinalliance.com/), [_Radio Rental_](https://radiorentalusa.com/) and [_Phoebe Reads a Mystery_](https://thisiscriminal.com/mystery/).

- Similarly to podcasts, I tended to listen to older music rather than new (plus I haven't had my finger on the musical pulse in decades). But some 2021 albums I liked: _Blue Banisters_ by Lana Del Rey, _Daddy’s Home_ by St. Vincent, _star-crossed_ by Kacey Musgraves, _In These Silent Days_ by Brandi Carlisle, _Open Door Policy_ by the Hold Steady, _The Path of Wellness_ by Sleater-Kinney, _Carnage_ by Nick Cave & Warren Ellis and _At My Piano_ by Brian Wilson.

- I liked starting to read comic books again, after many, many years away.

- I liked being able to get back to museums. (Photo below of the freshly installed [Hartwell Memorial Window](https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/9536/landscape-in-light-the-tiffany-window-at-the-art-institute-of-chicago) at the Art Institute of Chicago.)

- I liked being able to go back to school for a degree I long abandoned, I liked being able to travel a bit more than last year and I liked being able to make goals for this year.

- And I liked, and continue to like, vaccines.
