### Reading/Watching/Listening

- If, like me, you're obsessed with your memories of malls, might I recommend Alexandra Lange's [_Meet Me by the Fountain: An Inside History of the Mall_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ba57e2b9-ac08-4ca6-a3eb-ec6f4d6368b5)? It's well-researched and presented, and anchored by the real experiences and emotions we hold when it comes to those dying giants.
- I've been reading Laura Purcell's modern gothic novels, my favorite of which is [_The Poison Thread_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a15ab1da-5064-4cb9-9a3a-6d32627a57f8).
- I loved [_Pearl_](https://letterboxd.com/film/pearl-2022/).
- The documentary series on the history of Industrial Light and Magic, [_Light & Magic_](https://letterboxd.com/film/light-magic-2022-1/), is very detailed and pretty incredible.
- Mark Cousins's follow-up to his history of film series, [The Story of Film: A New Generation](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-story-of-film-a-new-generation/), is now available to stream in the US. Its highlighted examples are hit or miss, but he is nothing if not sincere about film and its future.
- Spin some Lydia Loveless for the last day of September.
