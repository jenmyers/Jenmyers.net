description:  The ones I liked from the past year.

I don't know at what point I stopped caring much about making objective values or determinations about films, but it definitely happened. Now I tend to look for whatever is interesting to me. This is a wide-ranging and occasionally chaotic criterion. Some of what interests me might be objectively good, some of it is probably objectively bad. All of which is to underscore that this is not a "best of" list. It's a list of films out of which I got something interesting, however mixed or slight or strange or incomprehensible. We're just going on vibes now, kids. Strap in.

<h3><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/red-rooms/"><em>Red Rooms</em></a></h3>

I anticipated that I would like this film based on its description, but no description could capture what this film truly is; but it ended up that I loved it. It's a sharp, sleek and stealthy beast of a movie. It eats you from the inside out. My favorite film, no qualifers, of the past year.

<h3><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/nosferatu-2024/"><em>Nosferatu</em></a></h3>

What can I say. I dug it. (Actually, [I can say a lot about it and I did](https://quietlittlehorrors.com/episode-06-01-nosferatu-2024/).)

<h3><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/longlegs/"><em>Longlegs</em></a></h3>

I've long been on record as an Oz Perkins fan and this felt like a natural continuation of his style and themes. Horror film as personal demon excavation. That might be just what it's for.

<h3><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/exhuma/"><em>Exhuma</em></a></h3>

South Korean cinema is good at combining various genres into single films, and _Exhuma_ makes a good example of it by weaving together folk horror, melodrama, slow burn, humor, societal commentary and good old-fashioned giant scary monsters. If you roll with what might seem like tonal shifts and the lengthy run time, it ties together quite nicely in the end.

<h3><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/late-night-with-the-devil/"><em>Late Night with the Devil</em></a></h3>

I heard a horror film podcaster speculate that this film might have involved them more if they had seen it in the theater—which I did, which might explain why it did involve me more than others I've heard. I liked how it played with the found footage format and I loved David Dastmalchian's haunted performance.

<h3><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-vourdalak/"><em>The Vourdalak</em></a></h3>

You know what the vampire genre needed? A shot of old folklore and a human-sized demon puppet. What a delirously weird movie.

<h3><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-substance/"><em>The Substance</em></a></h3>

A gonzo, woman-centered _Society_ for the Instagram era wrapped in a classic Hollywood upside-down fairy tale. It's a horror cartoon that goes too far, and the farther it went, the better I liked it. Raise of the glass to Demi, who deserves her accolades and more.

<h3><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/loop-track/"><em>Loop Track</em></a></h3>

This one is my pick for pleasant surprise of the year. It's a well-done low-budget film that carefully builds the vibe of one sort of film and then takes a hard left turn into a completely different sort of film, which it commits to completely. It delighted me. I generally don't believe in spoilers, but, if you watch it, don't look up anything more about it. Just go on the journey.

<h3><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/humanist-vampire-seeking-consenting-suicidal-person/"><em>Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person</em></a></h3>

Genre trappings make this sweet and funny French film special. Don't worry—it has a darkly happy ending.

<h3><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/i-saw-the-tv-glow/"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em></a></h3>

Is this strictly a horror film? I don't know. But director Schoenbrun continues to stake out the territory of emotional liminality and there is a core of spiritual horror in this film that chills to the bone.

<h3><a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/witches-2024/"><em>Witches</em></a></h3>

I like personal documentaries in general and, for some documentary topics, the personal is essential. _Witches_ is one of these documentaries, pulling from the filmmaker's experience of postpartum depression as well as cinematic representations of the history of unruly and/or unwell women accused of witchcraft. It's a huge, complex discussion that barely gets started in the film and it would be great to see it continued, especially when it comes to discussing how postpartum mental health resources are even scarcer for poorer women.

I also enjoyed to some extent: <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/abigail-2024/"><em>Abigail</em></a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/apartment-7a/"><em>Apartment 7A</em></a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/blackout-2023/"><em>Blackout</em></a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/cuckoo-2024/"><em>Cuckoo</em></a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/lovely-dark-and-deep/"><em>Lovely, Dark, and Deep</em></a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/oddity-2024/"><em>Oddity</em></a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/starve-acre/"><em>Starve Acre</em></a> and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/v-h-s-beyond/"><em>V/H/S/Beyond</em></a>.

I also put all [these films into a Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/jenmyers/list/favorite-horror-films-of-2024/), if you're into that sort of thing.
