The ends of years are exciting times for someone like me who loves to log, record and plan. The week between Christmas and New Year's Day I generally devote to gathering materials for the coming year (new planner and notebooks), sorting out my goals and progress lists (I keep a wealth of information stored once in spreadsheets, now in Airtable) and tallying up my media logs (I might miss my yearly book reading goal, but I crushed my film watching one, so we'll call it square).

<!-- more -->

I know, however, that not everything can be quantified. Not every piece of progress fits neatly into database tables or numbered lists. So I broke down this year's overall reflection into months, to pay better attention to the moments in between the numbers. There are still some numbers. I like numbers. But the numbers don't mean much without context.

__January__: I started the year in New Orleans, on vacation and unemployed.

I loved New Orleans. So much so that this year it felt natural that I should go back over the holidays. I didn't go, but I thought about it. I spent a week and a half there and travelled to various parts of the city and ate all the food. New Orleans felt slightly fantastical and yet utterly real.

Later in the month, _Bright Wall Dark Room_ published my essay about _Lady Bird_ and mothers and daughters and the [names we choose for ourselves](https://www.brightwalldarkroom.com/2018/01/26/the-names-we-choose-for-ourselves/).

__February__: I did some heavy adulting and created a will and trust documents. A strange exercise in contemplating finality, but it feels better being entirely prepared. Also for a period of time I got to refer to having meetings with my "estate laywer," which was fun. I continued my new job search. I officially started focusing on creative side projects, including learning more about filmmaking and storytelling. I also launched a premium version of my weekly newsletter.

__March__: My daughter and I travelled where everyone dreams of going in March—Cleveland. There we met a friend and saw Neil Gaiman as he answered questions and read stories and poems to us (and the rest of the audience).

Towards the end of March, I began a new job as a curriculum writer at [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/). Several months down the road, I can say that this is one of the  rare instances in tech when I found a place that seems to accept and support me and where I feel genuinely proud of being a part of the company. Overall, it was a good move.

__April__, __May__ & __June__: It was a fairly uneventful spring. I got used to a new job. In April I gave a talk and ran a Code and Cupcakes (beginning coding workshop for mothers and daughters) event at the [Mission Creek Festival](http://missioncreekfestival.com/) in Iowa City, Iowa. In June I got a new little bumblebee tattoo (by [Michelle Wanhala](https://www.instagram.com/mwanhala/) at Pioneer Tattoo).

__July__: I turned thirty-seven years old. To celebrate, I took myself to one of my favorite spots: House on the Rock in rural Wisconsin. Esmeralda was indifferent at best about my future, but I will maintain my optimism anyway.

I also stayed in the (relatively) legendary [Don Q Inn](https://www.donqinn.net/) which was ... an experience.

__August__: August was busy.

I ran my second 5k.

I went on a quick company-mandated trip to a field in England.

I got a glimpse of London.

And then I went on our annual end-of-summer trip to Disney World.

I also got my motorcycle riding permit.

__September__ & __October__: Fall was quiet and pleasant. I went to a Yayoi Kusama Infinity Room at the [wndr museum](https://wndrmuseum.com/).

![endless mirrored reflections][kusama]

And I returned to House on the Rock with family and friends in tow, as is now traditional for our Halloween celebrations.

__November__: I was sick and busy and it took forever to get back on track. Until well into ...

__December__: This hadn't been a particularly stressful or eventful year, but I was tired in December. I just focused on getting myself back to a routine of exercise and relative health.

I also went to the [biggest video game arcade in the US](https://www.gallopingghostarcade.com/). So I had that going for me.

And I redeveloped this section of my website to serve as a more regular blog, which is something I first created almost twenty years ago. I abandoned the practice several years ago. It's nice to be back. It will be even nicer to fill it up over the coming year.
