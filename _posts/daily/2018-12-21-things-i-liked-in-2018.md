I don't keep up with enough brand-new books, films, etc. to make comprehensive best-of lists at the end of the year. But here's a list of various things from 2018 that I liked. Some of these I've mentioned in my newsletter or on Twitter, but I tried specifically to highlight things I might not have talked about much. So maybe you'll find some hidden gems in the bunch.

<!-- more -->

- I saw a lot of great films this year, but [_The Favourite_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-favourite/) was ... well, you can figure it out.
- Orson Welles's unfinished final film had been in post-production purgatory for years, to the point most people assumed it would never be completed and released. And yet this year it was, thanks to... *checks notes* Netflix? I got to see this in a theater and beyond the basic thrill of seeing something I thought I'd never see, [_The Other Side of the Wind_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-other-side-of-the-wind/) was complex and sly and bewildering and brilliant.
- If you're among the few left to whom I have not yet recommened Madeline Miller's mythological retelling [_Circe_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959740-circe), consider it recommended.
- A fun and smart story with a young, spirited protagonist, Maureen Johnson's [_Truly Devious_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29589074-truly-devious) reads like a love letter to all of us who love to read mysteries.
- Speaking of mysteries, I continue to be truly impressed by Kristen Lepionka, whose second book featuring her Columbus, Ohio-based bisexual detective Roxane Weary, [_What You Want To See_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36475584-what-you-want-to-see), is well worth picking up.
- I never read the graphic novel that the miniseries [_The End of the F--ing World_](https://www.netflix.com/title/80175722) was based on but I loved this story about a budding psychopath, a dissatisfied teenage girl and their fucked-up road trip.
- One of my golden screen rules is "watch anything Ben Whishaw is in," because even if the thing as a whole isn't that great, he is always great himself. As it turns out, [_A Very English Scandal_](https://letterboxd.com/film/a-very-english-scandal/) is pretty great as a whole, and Hugh Grant is tremendously good in it as well. It's snappy and cheeky, and I suspect the fact that it's not a ponderous-and-therefore-perceived-as-more-important history piece led it to get overlooked. But it's worth watching.
- [_Sharp Objects_](https://letterboxd.com/film/sharp-objects/) was not overlooked, but it was fantastic.
- I made it a point to fill in some of my television gaps this past year, which included watching the entirety of _Breaking Bad_, which led to watching [_Better Call Saul_](https://www.amc.com/shows/better-call-saul)—which I love. I haven't even seen all of season four yet, but I'm mentioning it anyway because I love it.
- Another favorite television show from this past year is _The Good Place_. I'm not making a big deal of that here, because I barely shut up about it—but I will make a big a deal about the [_The Good Place_ podcast](https://www.nbc.com/the-good-place/exclusives/tgp-podcast). It's an unique look behind the scenes to not only this particular show but the process of making good television in general, and it's wonderful.
- One of my favorite fiction podcasts, [_Alice Isn’t Dead_](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/aliceisntdead/), wrapped up its third season and entire storyline, and stayed spooky, conspiratorial and roadside-attraction-weird until the end.
- On the nonfiction podcast front, [_Disgraceland_](https://www.disgracelandpod.com/) was my find of the year. True crime meets pop music history meets punk rock storytelling.
- One of my more general resolutions for 2018 was to see more local theater, and out of that endeavor, I discovered the delightful play [_She Kills Monsters_](https://www.samuelfrench.com/p/8807/she-kills-monsters/), as produced by [Prop Thtr](http://www.propthtr.org/) earlier this year in Chicago. A tale of Dungeons and Dragons and geek culture and friends and sisters and making your own identity. Obviously this is difficult to seek out, but if by chance you see it being performed near you, go for it.
- Favorite albums, in no particular order: Florence + the Machine, [_High as Hope_](https://open.spotify.com/album/0pKZJj9GzcKPCS8r4IaksA?si=LffBFR_uSaKSGMdgiQog2Q); Janelle Monáe, [_Dirty Computer_](https://open.spotify.com/album/2PjlaxlMunGOUvcRzlTbtE?si=f_Dz-qspTX2geehPhb7dcg); Open Mike Eagle, [_What Happens When I Try to Relax_](https://open.spotify.com/album/7qTEGu0Gvikwk1n8SwjmEL?si=1mFyhACjTeyh3ySsimV5mQ); Kacey Musgraves, [_Golden Hour_](https://open.spotify.com/album/7f6xPqyaolTiziKf5R5Z0c?si=Pj1Eh1zoTj-tbbmO1UuAsg); The Breeders, [_All Nerve_](https://open.spotify.com/album/0uanYSaBkcu0ztk0WjHnx5?si=spObIFHhS2-qY-KWQ5TH2A).
- In notable longform, I appreciated reading [Pamela Colloff on the Mickey Bryan murder for _ProPublica_](https://features.propublica.org/blood-spatter/mickey-bryan-murder-blood-spatter-forensic-evidence/).
- [Taffy Brodesser-Akner on Tonya Harding for the _New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/movies/tonya-harding-i-tonya-nancy-kerrigan-scandal.html) was also great.
- And [Zach Baron's profile of Brendan Fraser for _GQ_](https://www.gq.com/story/what-ever-happened-to-brendan-fraser) stuck in my mind after reading it for a long time.
- In 2018 I started studying tarot as a storytelling/reflection tool. I've found that [Jessica Dore’s Twitter account and daily tarot card interpretations](https://twitter.com/thejessicadore) to be lovely source of insight.
- I've mentioned before that in 2018 I deliberately started working my way through a [“greatest films” list](https://letterboxd.com/jenmyers/list/1000-greatest-films-tsfdt-ranking/) as a way to fill in some cinematic knowledge gaps. I watched twenty-eight films I hadn't previously seen from the first hundred of that list and not only did I learn that a lot of those films are really good (who knew), it reactivated my love of watching films in a way I hadn't known since I was much younger. And that is a good thing.
