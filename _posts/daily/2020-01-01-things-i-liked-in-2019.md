While I like lists, I’m not that interested in best-of lists. Making them, at least. I never feel I’m capable of making one both comprehensive and correct enough to earn the title; not only it is virtually impossible to absorb every single item in a category in order to rank it, such rankings can hardly be objective enough to reflect a platonically pure “best.” Best then to just avoid it all and make a list of deeply subjective, gloriously biased favorites. In that spirit, here are a bunch of things I liked in 2019.

<!-- more -->

- My favorite film of this year is [_Transit_](https://letterboxd.com/film/transit-2018/), all the more so because it led me to the rest of the work of director Christian Petzold. Something about his way of building stories from emotional logic, operating with individuals but echoing collective desires and fears, resonates with me. _Transit_ is a particularly effective and unfortunately timely story.
- I also very much liked: [_The Irishman_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-irishman-2019/), [_Parasite_](https://letterboxd.com/film/parasite-2019/), [_Her Smell_](https://letterboxd.com/film/her-smell/), [_Uncut Gems_](https://letterboxd.com/film/uncut-gems/), [_The Lighthouse_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lighthouse-2019/), [_Midsommar_](https://letterboxd.com/film/midsommar/), [_Us_](https://letterboxd.com/film/us-2019/), [_Booksmart_](https://letterboxd.com/film/booksmart/), [_Hustlers_](https://letterboxd.com/film/hustlers-2019/) and [_Little Women_](https://letterboxd.com/film/little-women-2019/).
- I’m giving [_Under the Silver Lake_](https://letterboxd.com/film/under-the-silver-lake/) my Stealth Favorite Award: I mostly felt bewildered upon seeing this, but it’s stuck in my head since. A love letter to and an indictment of a heartbroken generation obsessed with finding some significance amidst distraction and chaos.
- And my Better than It Has Any Business To Be Award goes to [_Crawl_](https://letterboxd.com/film/crawl-2019/), a hugely satisfying monster movie that does a lot with a simple premise and a taut storyline. I enjoyed it far more than certain large-budget epics.
- There was so much good television this year. It’s hard to beat the second season of [_Fleabag_](https://www.amazon.com/Fleabag-Season-1/dp/B01J4SSP6E), but I also liked: [_Russian Doll_](https://www.netflix.com/title/80211627) (Season 1), [_Barry_](https://www.hbo.com/barry) (Season 2), [_Mindhunter_](https://www.netflix.com/title/80114855) (Season 2), [_Fosse/Verdon_](https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/fosse-verdon), [_Gentleman Jack_](https://www.hbo.com/gentleman-jack) (Season 1), [_The Act_](https://www.hulu.com/series/the-act-8cc910fe-b59e-46a5-9966-16c4e0ed208d) (Season 1), [_Dark_](https://www.netflix.com/title/80100172) (Season 2), [_Harlots_](https://www.hulu.com/series/harlots-18edbd1f-3e9f-46a0-8dc4-02ff7b1eef63) (Season 3), [_Kingdom_](https://www.netflix.com/Title/80180171) (Season 1), [_Superstore_](https://www.nbc.com/superstore) (Season 5), [_What We Do in the Shadows_](https://www.hulu.com/series/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-0b10c46a-12f0-4357-8a00-547057b49bac) (Season 1), [_The Good Place_](https://www.nbc.com/the-good-place) (Season 4) and [_The Mandalorian_](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-mandalorian/3jLIGMDYINqD) (Season 1).
- This year I watched far more movies than read books, and I didn’t read many newly published books. But I managed a decent list of new-to-me books. My favorite find was Sara Gran’s [_Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9231999-claire-dewitt-and-the-city-of-the-dead), and the two subsequent Claire DeWitt books.
- I also enjoyed reading: [_The Year of the Monkey_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44776548-year-of-the-monkey) by Patti Smith, [_Geek Love_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13872.Geek_Love) by Katherine Dunn, [_Zeroville_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/921569.Zeroville) by Steve Erickson, [_The Little Stranger_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7234875-the-little-stranger) by Sarah Waters, [_We Sold Our Souls_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37715859-we-sold-our-souls) by Grady Hendrix, [_Seduction: Sex, Lies, and Stardom in Howard Hughes's Hollywood_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36501754-seduction) by Katrina Longworth, [_Lady in the Lake_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41735375-lady-in-the-lake) by Laura Lippman, [_The Drowning Girl_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11515328-the-drowning-girl) by Caitlin R. Kiernan and [_The Lady from the Black Lagoon: Hollywood Monsters and the Lost Legacy of Milicent Patrick_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34993030-the-lady-from-the-black-lagoon) by Mallory O’Meara.
- In the realm of new music, I particularly liked listening to: [_The Highwomen_](https://open.spotify.com/album/7sGTt1N5XMIQPCYHAnO1Pl?si=IqMyUAg7SYCAe90mURfOnw) by the Highwomen, [_Remind Me Tomorrow_](https://open.spotify.com/album/2dvXk4nacVRmDSnbKniwrS?si=UcP8UoX_Qb6KjBCsZ3K3HQ) by Sharon Van Etten, [_Norman Fucking Rockwell_](https://open.spotify.com/album/5XpEKORZ4y6OrCZSKsi46A?si=6UHmC5D1ST2s4yC9gibzLA) by Lana Del Rey, [_Western Stars_](https://open.spotify.com/album/6BhqPpIgY83rqoZ2L78Lte?si=71KuA3fzQwGXxf-oaL9RHQ) by Bruce Springsteen and [_Thrashing Thru the Passion_](https://open.spotify.com/album/16XUMEdixzqRXVVPZsB3ak?si=v9jcJM16StKbat73YqtPxw) by the Hold Steady. 
- I came across the [Creative Independent](https://thecreativeindependent.com/), a collection of interviews and guides on creativity and creative work, and I’ve appreciated the accumulated perspectives and advice.
- The [Criterion Channel](https://www.criterionchannel.com/) launched earlier this year and I think it keeps getting better and better. Not only do they offer their consistent array of classic art films, but they regularly feature new collections, including a lot of work by women. It’s become essential.
- I didn’t see as much theater this year as I would have liked, but I did get to see the Chicago premiere of _Ghost Quartet_, a sort of musical mixtape for the stage that weaves together ghost stories and love stories, jazz music and fairy tales, drinking songs and funereal dirges. It’s an unique experience I would recommend to anyone who finds the opportunity to see it staged, but you can also grab the [_Ghost Quartet_ audio directly from the show's creator](https://davemalloy.bandcamp.com/album/ghost-quartet).
- I went to the [International Museum of Surgical Science](https://imss.org/), a sometimes strange collection of medical history housed in a lovely old Chicago lakefront mansion. I liked the mansion as much, if not more, than the collection. And they showed me, upon my request, the 100-year-old working elevator.
- In 2019, I also liked: spending more time thinking rather than producing, being comfortable with practicing rather than excelling and dismissing the limited viewpoints of cynicism.
- And, in 2019, I liked Baby Yoda.
