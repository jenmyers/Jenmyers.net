Reading has been slow again this past month. I blame winter. But I've been reading a few screenplays, which I count as books, for counting purposes. Here's what I read in March.

<!-- more -->

- __[_The Wife_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34971475-the-wife), Alafair Burke__: Alafair Burke is one of the best thriller novelists writing right now. You basically can't do any better if you're in the mood for a thoughtful, engaging, woman-focused thriller. Her other most recent book, [_The Ex_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25817395-the-ex), is also worth reading.
- __[_Brick_](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/985b9a_6252d37c4749471fb30e4942b729576a.pdf), [_The Brothers Bloom_](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/985b9a_aa34b031c3554f9ea0985007f41ca593.pdf), and [_Looper_](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/985b9a_e3a024f9e6e64400a928e09a62005b39.pdf), Rian Johnson__: I mentioned _Brick_ last month, but it seemed appropriate to include it as the trio of screenplays writer/director Rian Johnson makes available on [his website](https://www.rian-johnson.com/screenplays). They're all films I enjoyed quite a bit, but haven't seen in a while, which is not a bad way to experience reading a screenplay. And these are all richly written screenplays with involving stories. Links up there are directly to the PDFs that you can download.
- __[_Barton Fink_](http://www.screenplay.com/downloads/scripts/Barton%20Fink.pdf), Ethan Coen and Joel Coen__: Lately I've been bouncing back and forth between Johnson's screenplays and the Coens', which is a pretty decent screenplay realm to bounce around. _Barton Fink_ is a particular favorite film of mine, although, similar to the others I mentioned, I haven't seen it in a while. You pick up different things from a screenplay than the completed film, although the Coens explicitly write with their direction in mind. Overall, however, I'm picking up screenplay rhythms by reading good ones.
