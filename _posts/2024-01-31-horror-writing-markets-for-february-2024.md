I skipped a post for January, because reasons, but there are plenty of opportunities for February—including a couple that close very soon, so hurry if you're into those.

### Open Now

- [_Bowery Gothic_](https://bowerygothic.submittable.com/submit) is looking for literary stories on the loose theme of "winter ghosts." This one closes on February 2.
- If you've got a punchy, old-fashioned genre tale, send it over to [_Epic Echoes Magazine_](https://epicechoesmag.wixsite.com/epic-echoes-magazine) until the end of February.

### Open Soon

- [_House of Gamut_](https://houseofgamut.moksha.io/publication/house-of-gamut) opens at the beginning of the month to fiction—but move fast, they fill up very quickly.
- Spindle House Press's [_Tales from the Tarot_](https://www.spindlehousepress.com/submissions/tarot-tales) will be open for flash fiction submissions on the theme of the Ace of Wands tarot card from February 1-15.

### Anthology Calls

- Flame Tree Press has extended the deadline for the [Medusa collection](https://blog.flametreepublishing.com/fantasy-gothic/medusa-submissions-0) until February 4.
- [Bag of Bones Press](https://www.bagofbonespress.com/submission-calls) wants dark fiction short stories on the theme of "skin" until May 31.
- Sliced Up Press is open for queer horror fiction and poetry submissions to the anthology [_Slay and Slay Again! An Anthology of Queer Horror_](https://sliceduppress.com/submissions/) until the end of February.
- If you've got a misunderstood bit of trunk flash fiction, zine [_Xanax Hamster_](https://frombeyondpress.com/books/xanax-hamster/) wants to read it—but they're only open February 3-4 (2-4 for writers who identify as BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, and/or disabled).
- Burial Books is open for stories for their [_Inanimate Things: Volume Two_](https://burialbooks.com/submissions/) anthology until May 1.
