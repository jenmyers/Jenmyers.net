- [Netflix's DVD service, to which I have long enthusiastically subscribed, is ending in September](https://www.avclub.com/netflix-is-killing-its-dvds-by-mail-service-1850350666). This is a huge bummer and I hope their massive library of movies finds a good new home.

- I've seen a lot of folks flock from Twitter to Substack lately. I get it if that's what works out for them, but I'm not sure if it's going to end up being much of an improvement. Especially given the fact that [the Substack CEO doesn't realize he's just become the Nazi bar](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/14/substack-ceo-chris-best-doesnt-realize-hes-just-become-the-nazi-bar/). For what it's worth: a couple of years ago [I wrote about why I moved my newsletter from the Substack platform](https://jenmyers.net/notes/a-digital-room-of-ones-own.html).

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I picked up [_Daphne_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c16815f9-69d0-49c1-a96f-464083430e65) by Josh Malerman not knowing much about it or its author and it was a knockout.

- Catriona Ward's [_Sundial_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/98094ce6-8033-4d1b-ae1a-10887e673eca) is her trademark kind of beautiful and horrifying.

- On Shudder, I discovered [_And Soon the Darkness_](https://letterboxd.com/film/and-soon-the-darkness/), a lean 1970 thriller that does the thing better than I expected it to.

- I watched [_Swarm_](https://letterboxd.com/film/swarm-2023-1/). I found it fascinating, although I also think some of it slipped my grasp. I recommend pairing it with this [thoughtful review by Angelica Jade Bastién](https://www.vulture.com/article/swarm-finale-black-madwoman-analysis-dominique-fishback.html).

- I finished [_BEEF_](https://letterboxd.com/film/beef-2023/) before I learned about one cast member's problematic backstory. You might want to look that up to gauge your own comfort level before moving forward with the show. But, if the show's creators have managed to smooth that over well enough for you, the show itself is pretty great.

- Some new Hold Steady out there.
