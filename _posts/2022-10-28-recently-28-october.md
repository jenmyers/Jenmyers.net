description:  Regular round-up of links and media recommendations
---

I didn't realize it, but I must not have been keeping up on internet reading because I have no links to share. I do, however, have a long list of books read and movies/shows watched. They're almost all of the dark variety, which is normal around here, but which also make particularly good Halloween recommendations.

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- Over the summer I came across Ray Russell's [_The Case Against Satan_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/bf7dceb6-9377-4ff0-be20-d5ab0e053184), which was fantastic, and I wondered why I hadn't been familiar with his work before. This collection of his gothic tales, [_Haunted Castles: The Complete Gothic Stories_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/5be68a6a-3345-4dc8-976a-20b1bcf52b62), I liked even more. An absolute must for anyone into gothic horror literature.
- Speaking of which, I read [_Carmilla_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/282ca7c1-e12e-40c9-8a11-3e2f00db0dfe) by J. Sheridan Le Fanu, the classic vampire novella predating _Dracula_ and it's a lesbian vampire horror story dream.
- And speaking of modern horror classics that should be more well known, I read Robert M. Coates's [_Wisteria Cottage_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/bb3c207e-388c-4dac-bb21-47aa2c79b135), a knockout of midcentury psychological horror.
- [_Inheriting Her Ghosts_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a5060535-6bc8-4b6d-8f03-6c2bf340655e) by S.H. Cooper is a Shirley Jackson Award nominee from last year that I recently plucked off of my reading list and enjoyed very much. Another gothic-tinged tale, but from a modern writer and with a redemptive closure.
- At the Chicago International Film Festival, I saw the _Knives Out_ follow-up [_Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery_](https://letterboxd.com/film/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery/) and it is delightful. Please go see this one in the theater during its all-too-short week-long theatrical run, it's an experience for a crowd.
- The Criterion Channel has a banger collection of [80s Horror](https://www.criterionchannel.com/80s-horror) to watch and virtually everything on the list is worth a watch. Favorite first-time watches for me so far are [_The Hidden_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-hidden/) and [_The Keep_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-keep/).
- Speaking of banger collections of horror films, Shudder has one celebrating the feminist horror film memoir text [House of Psychotic Women](https://www.shudder.com/collections/watch/house-of-psychotic-women/633c5a5d8f37e3000106f00b) and it's 200% my sort of thing.
- Also! Shudder's [_Queer for Fear_](https://www.shudder.com/series/watch/queer-for-fear/ce5453d674d6fde5?season=1) series is truly fantastic. I wish there were a dozen seasons.

Happy Halloween-time, friends. Stay safe, stay spooky.
