- “Just as there are transitional times in the life of the world — dark periods of disorientation between two world systems, periods in which humanity loses the ability to comprehend itself and collapses into chaos in order to rebuild itself around a new organizing principle — there are such times in every human life, times when the entire system seems to cave in and curl up into a catatonia of anguish and confusion, difficult yet necessary for our growth.” From _The Marginalian_, [the art of the sacred pause and despair as a catalyst of regeneration](https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/12/24/marett-humility/?mc\_cid=9720fa63f0).


### Reading/Watching/Listening

- As far as books go, I’ve mostly been reading all the Inspector Morse mystery novels. I always like to read mysteries at night but especially dark winter nights. Recommended.

- I caught a screening of [_Bluebeard’s Castle_](https://letterboxd.com/film/bluebeards-castle/), Michael Powell’s vivid nightmare of an opera adaptation, and it was so gratifying to see the cinematic potential of opera fully realized. I loved it.

- I watched [_Emily_](https://letterboxd.com/film/emily-2022/), the 2022 film about Emily Brontë, and was pleasantly surprised. It’s a much fresher take on the period biopic than I expected, less interested in facts than in emotional truths, and its bold style really pays off.

- I feel compelled to say something in defense of [_Wolf Man_](https://letterboxd.com/film/wolf-man-2025/), which I didn’t think completely came together but laid enough careful groundwork for interesting ideas that I’m inclined to lay it at the feet of studio interference. It seems like a film that got watered down. I would have liked to see it take its ideas further.

- I’ve set myself the goal of watching as many Ingmar Bergman films as possible this year and I assembled a [fairly ambitious Letterboxd list](https://letterboxd.com/jenmyers/list/bergman-a-rama-2025/) to prove it. Feel free to play along at home for a dark, weird time.

- Earlier this month, Maurice Ravel’s _Boléro_ entered the public domain and the news led me to this delightful performance of it by the WDR Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Alondra de la Parra.
