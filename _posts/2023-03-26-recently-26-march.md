- “The originality in a narrative comes from you, the author, the artist. The originality comes out in the execution. It is there in the effort.” [Writer Chuck Wendig on AI and the fetishization of ideas.](https://terribleminds.com/ramble/2023/02/16/a-i-and-the-fetishization-of-ideas/)

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I'm in progress with Stephen Graham Jones's [_Don’t Fear the Reaper_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0ac5aea3-c3b5-4869-8c75-0c0905205c08). No surprises here that it's great. Jones really kills with endings, though, so let's see where this one ends up.

- I'm also in progress on [_How To Sell a Haunted House_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/06976a66-3ca6-41e0-85ca-fdb3ed7b44ef) by Grady Hendrix. This strikes me as a bit different from Hendrix's earlier books, in a way I like. It's a little more psychological and a little more surprising.

- I watched [_The 12th Victim_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-12th-victim/) on Hulu. It's uneven as a documentary, but as a reclamation of Caril Ann Fugate's perspective, it's a triumph. Even if you think you know all there is to know about the lStarkweather killings, or especially if you think you know all there is to know: this is worth watching.

- New Lana, folks.
