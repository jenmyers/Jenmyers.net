### Reading/Watching/Listening

- [_The Death of Jane Lawrence_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/5386dd38-2fa7-44ac-a19f-1279823c73ff) by Caitlin Starling is a twisted gothic romance/mystery full of body horror and perplexing ritualism. It's a strange stew, but it works.
- I caught the 1981 film [_Dead & Buried_](https://letterboxd.com/film/dead-buried/) and it's great. Like a gorier _Twilight Zone_ episode gracefully stretched to feature length. Let's talk about this one way more.
- Obviously season two of [_Russian Doll_](https://www.netflix.com/title/80211627) is fantastic.
- If you want a clever and breezy Agatha Christie romp, [_Why Didn’t They Ask Evans_](https://watch.britbox.com/us/why-didnt-they-ask-evans-cta1), from director Hugh Laurie, will fit the bill admirably.
- Hey, new Florence:
