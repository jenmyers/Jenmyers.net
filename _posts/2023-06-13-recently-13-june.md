It's been a minute since my last round-up, so some of these links and recommendations are of a minor vintage. Still bubbly though.

### Links

- Megan Abbott on answering the question: [“You’ve never had an abortion, have you?”](https://www.vogue.com/article/megan-abbott-abortion-personal-essay)

- [The last gamble of Tokyo Joe.](https://www.chicagomag.com/chicago-magazine/may-2023/the-last-gamble-of-tokyo-joe/) An absolute knockout of a story.

- [A sincere and thoughtful farewell to Kenneth Anger](https://www.vulture.com/2023/05/kenneth-anger-filmmaker-obituary-appreciation.html).

- [An oral history of MTV News](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/feature/mtv-news-oral-history-kurt-loder-tabitha-soren-1235484146/), on the sad occasion of its official passing. An older generation might remember Peter Jennings delivering the important news of the day; I remember Kurt Loder.

- [Roman and Gerri are _Succession_'s true tragic romance.](https://www.avclub.com/roman-and-gerri-are-successions-true-tragic-romance-1850419400)

- In the wake of Twitter, [what is the new new reading environment](https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-45/the-intellectual-situation/the-new-new-reading-environment/)?

### Reading/Watching/Listening

- I'm on record calling [_Hatching_](https://letterboxd.com/film/hatching/) the horror version of _Turning Red_. Mothers teaching daughters how to handle their monsters. It's my sort of territory. (Note: We'll be covering this on an upcoming episode of [Quiet Little Horrors](https://quietlittlehorrors.com/), if you want to hear more about it.)

- I don't think the new Shudder film [_Influencer_](https://letterboxd.com/film/influencer-2022/) is a great film, but it is an interesting film that rarely took the turns I expected. I appreciated its refusal to explain itself.

- I dug the second season of _Perry Mason_. Shame there won't be any more. It would be cool if streaming television would get over their "cancel solid shows after only two seasons" thing.

- _Yellowjackets_ wrapped up an uneven season two but kept the 90s needle drops coming, so I'm okay with it. I think this show is a little more melodrama than we originally clocked it to be, but I also think that doesn't have to be a bad thing.

- Speaking of the podcast, soon we're talking about one of my all-time favorite films, [_Picnic at Hanging Rock_](https://letterboxd.com/film/picnic-at-hanging-rock/), so I took the opportunity to read the [original novel by Joan Lindsay](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c6f945a0-3f11-4c99-8871-a49ef1e5edc6) for the first time. Recommended.

- In the same thematic vein, I read [_The Virgin Suicides_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/417922b8-8f74-4498-bc3a-60b1855d80b9)by Jeffrey Eugenides. I have yet to watch the film adaption but that's next.

- In the past, I recommended Lewis Hyde's book [_Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth and Art_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9e84aea0-688f-4b3d-a07c-a70dafe28719). I just finished reading his [_The Gift: How the Creative Spirit Transforms the World_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/067631b2-3c53-4ed4-aa43-56bfb5be2cf8) and it seems essential for anyone figuring out how to make making art a sustainable part of their life.

- Speaking of _Yellowjackets_, a treat for us forty-somethings:
