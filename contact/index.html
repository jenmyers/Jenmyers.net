<h2 id="speaking">Speaking requests</h2>

<p>For the most part, I am not currently accepting requests to speak at conferences and meetups. If you have an unique event that you would like me to consider speaking at, please send all available details to <a href="mailto:hello@jenmyers.net">hello@jenmyers.net</a>.</p>

<h2>Mentoring/advice/networking requests</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, I do not have the bandwidth now for individual mentoring/advice/networking requests. If you represent a company and want input on topics like increasing hiring diversity, teaching designers development, on boarding junior developers or similar, <a href="mailto:hello@jenmyers.net">please email me for my consulting rate</a>.</p>

<h2>Job offers (freelance or full-time)</h2>

<p>I have a full-time job and Iâ€™m not available for unsolicited work right now. Unless you want to offer me the position of Chief Collector of Animated Otter Gifs. In which case, you should email me immediately.</p>
