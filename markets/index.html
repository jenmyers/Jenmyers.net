<p>A regularly updated database of horror writing markets: magazines, book publishers, anthologies and contests. For new submission calls, watch my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/category/writing-markets.html">writing market notes</a>. I post new calls every month as well as adding them to the database.</p>

<p><em>Note: I'm still filling in some database information, so stay tuned for more details and more markets.</em></p>

<p><strong>Tips for use:</strong> You can copy any information in the records below. Look under "Views" for a series of views filtered for particular criteria, such as "Flash Fiction," "Cosmic Horror," or "Paying Markets." You can also filter the records yourself by different criteria.</p>
